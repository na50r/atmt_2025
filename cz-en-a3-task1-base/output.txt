the main objective of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) in active and healthy ageing is to increase by 2020 the average length of healthy life in the EU by two years.
: Partnership aims to improve the quality of life of older citizens and more effective healthcare solutions.
will focus on the use of innovation at a larger scale than now, in such areas such as promotion of health, prevention, timely diagnosis and treatment, integrated health and social care systems based on cooperation as well as assisting technologies.
, the Commission will analyse responses to consultation to obtain a clear view of the potential and capacity of innovation in various areas that have an impact on ageing at today.
, according to these answers, the next procedure in the European Innovation Partnership is also planning on the basis of these responses.
. Online consultation is also taking place with the conference on the European Partnership for Active and Healthy Age, which is now held in Brussels today.
more than 150 representatives of stakeholders discuss their views as to transform partnerships into specific actions.
: European Partnership for Innovation in active and healthy ageing is part of the EU's "union innovation strategy" which is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy aimed at converting ideas in jobs, environmental growth and social progress (IP/10/1288).
: EU innovation aims to achieve scientific results at world level, to change the way of cooperation between public and private sectors, particularly through innovation partnerships, and to remove barriers (such as cost patents, market fragmentation, slow introduction of standards and insufficient qualifications) currently preventing rapid penetration of ideas on the market.
: this corresponds to the objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe, which is fully exploited ICT potential and promote prosperity and improving the quality of life (see IP/10/581, MEMO/10/199 and MEMO/10/200).

, as regards Asia, initiatives aimed at regional cooperation in nutrition nutrition matters should be strengthened.
: Harmonisation of EU intervention Access to food security in developing countries must be based on the principles of the Paris Declaration on the effectiveness of assistance, the Action Programme from the EU Accra and the Code of EU rules as regards the work on development policy.
. EU and Member States should, according to their comparative advantages, identify regions and countries in relation to which work should be divided and coordinated by their activities under the guidance of a particular main donor.
. EU and Member States have several policy frameworks and financial instruments to help partner countries to deal with food security problems.
more effective measures should help harmonise policies, closer to the coherence of tools and coordination with private investors.
: the consistency of policies for development[26] in the field of food security will be developed through a range of policy instruments including agriculture, trade, fisheries, fight against climate change, environmental protection and research.
, this cohesion was strengthened by reforming the common agricultural policy and future reforms will take into account the global food security objectives.
: The future reform of the common fisheries policy will further increase the coherence of European fisheries policies and fisheries methods, of one and development objectives, of the other part.
, not least, the achievement of balanced, comprehensive and ambitious results of the Doha Development Programme would strengthen the international trade system, which should be favourable to food security.
: Improve the coherence of the EU's international management system and Member States should better align the way food security is managed internationally and support the accelerated reform of the Food Safety Committee in the world (CFS) which is the central authority in that area.
. The Committee reformed should seek the power of supervision in other specific areas affecting food security, such as food aid and nutrition.
, the priorities of the three UN agencies established in Rome (FAO, WFP, IFAD) should be further vulnerable and their mutual cooperation should also be improved in order to synergies.
: UNECE Reform and ongoing review of the role and priorities of FAO are opportunities to increase quality and efficiency.

-floor flying the flag of a Member State which does not have quotas defined in point 1 shall not fish in this area with the use of equipment belonging to one of the groups of gear defined in point 3, unless the quota is allocated on the basis of the transfer pursuant to Article 20(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 and, if the days at sea are not allocated to the sea referred to in point 13 of this Annex.

. It is not necessary that the question be raised by the parties itself; the national judge may also refer it without the proposal.
. Application for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation Each court has jurisdiction to refer the Court to the Court of Justice a question concerning the interpretation of Community law rules, where it considers it necessary to resolve the dispute submitted to it.
, contrary to the court whose decisions cannot be challenged by the remedies under national law, it is essentially required to submit to the Court of Justice such a question, unless there is a case-law in the area (and any new framework does not raise real doubts as to the possibility of applying that case-law) or is the correct way of interpreting Community rules absolutely clear.
. The Court of First Instance of which may be challenged by remedies may, in particular where the case is sufficiently clarified on the basis of the case-law of the Court, may decide itself on the correct interpretation of Community law and its application to it by the facts.
. The reference for a preliminary ruling may, however, be in a suitable stage of the procedure, be particularly useful in the case-law, in relation to the new question of interpretation of the general importance for the uniform application of Community law in the Union or, if the case-law does not appear to be applicable to a completely new factual framework.
, the national court is required to explain what the interpretation necessary to order its judgment is necessary.
. Application for a preliminary ruling concerning the validity of the case If national courts have the opportunity to refuse the pleas in law relating to invalidity which are before them, the possibility of declaring Community act invalid falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
. Each national court must therefore refer the reference for a preliminary ruling if it has doubts as to the validity of the Community measure, indicating the reasons for which it considers that the Community act could be liable to be in force.
. However, if the national court has serious doubts as to the validity of the Community act based on a national act, it may exceptionally suspend temporarily the implementation of the latter act or in that regard to take any other precautionary measure.
. It is then required to ask the question relating to the validity of the Court and to state the reasons why it considers that the Community act is not valid.
. When a reference for a preliminary ruling from the national court may lodge a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling as soon as it finds that the decision on the question or interpretation or validity of the decision is necessary to enable the judgment to be given; it is a national court which may best assess in what stage of the procedure is such a request to be lodged.
, however, it is desirable that the decision to refer questions at the stage of the procedure where the judge is able to define the facts and legal framework of the problem so that the Court should have all the evidence necessary to verify that the Community law is applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings.
, it may also be shown in order to ensure that the question referred for a preliminary ruling is given after the contractor discussion of the case.
. The form of a reference for a preliminary ruling The decision of the decision of the national court ruling may be adopted in any form which the national law admits to the case of procedural issues.
, however, it must be held that this document is the basis for proceedings which takes place before the Court of Justice and that the Court must have knowledge available to it which allows it to give a useful answer to the national court.

. If the 10-year limitation period should start running until the transfer of APSA vaccine to the Ministry of Health, it would have to be determined precise moment of selling APMSD vaccines to determine the date of the start of the limitation period.
. Whether, under this assumption, the time-limit for APSA would be interrupted by bringing an action against APMSD ( 36 ) on 16 October 2002 would be brought before the expiry of the 10-year period if the medical service was sold to the Ministry of Health as soon as it was initiated in circulation on 16 October 1992 .
. Even if the exact moment of selling the medical ministry could no longer be detected and it could only be defined for the period between 22 September 1992 – the date of adoption of the APMSD vaccine – and on 3 November 1992 – the vaccination of the opponent – would be interrupted in any event by opening proceedings against APSA on 16 October 2002 in any event.
. If APSA would have to demonstrate the moment of putting the vaccine into circulation. ( 38 ) .
. If APSA as a manufacturer could only define this moment as a period starting over a period of more than ten years before the bringing of an action, it would have been less than ten years before it, APSa would not only be a manufacturer of proof of the burden but also the probative risk of determining the precise time of the time limitation period.
. Even if the precise moment of circulation was not intended, the court proceedings on 16 October 2002 in any event would have started timely, and therefore, the effects of the interruption of the limitation period should therefore be effected.

. Like other antiagreganic medicinal products, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients with potential risk of increased bleeding after trauma, operation or due to other pathological conditions and, if co-administration of clopidogrel and ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) including cox-2 inhibitors or selective serotonin inhibitors (SRI).
per-treated patients should be carefully monitored whether or not any signs of bleeding appear, including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiological performance or surgery.
. concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended because it may increase the bleeding intensity (see section 4.5).
. If the patient is to undergo the planned operation and antiagregatory effect is not temporarily desirable, clopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days before the performance.
. Patients should warn physicians before planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy before and dental physicians that they take clopidogrel prior to clopidogrel prior to scheduled surgery or other pharmacotherapy.
. Klopidogrel prolongs bleeding time and should therefore be administered to patients with tendency to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular) caution.
. 4 Patients should be informed that if they take clopidogrel (samotent or combined with ASA), the bleeding constation could last longer than usual and that they should inform their doctor about each unusual bleeding (local or duration).
-treatment thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) The thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was reported very rarely after the use of clopidogrel, sometimes after short exposure.
-coloured thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated either with neurological findings, renal dysfunction or fever.
. TTP is potentially fatal condition requiring an unreasonable treatment including plasmamapheresis.
, the haemophilia received after clopidogrel has been reported with haemophilia obtained.
. In cases where an adduced partial thromboplastin time prolongation is confirmed (aPTT) with bleeding or without it, the possibility obtained by haemophilia is to be taken into account.
diagnosis patients with confirmed haemophilia should be treated with specialised physician and clopidogrel administration should be terminated.
recent stroke due to the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended within the first 7 days of acute ischemical stroke.

, in this regard, the Commission intends to submit a Committee on the Notice referred to in Article 13 of the Work Programme Directive, which contains some of the elements below mentioned.
. If necessary, the Commission will also consider whether it will give incentives to judicial proceedings to supplement the active implementation of the activities described below.
: Completion of the harmonised framework for maping methods Despite improving the comparability of strategic noise mapping, the situation is not far from ideal.
, it is apparent from the ongoing evaluation that it is still difficult to provide comparable data on the number of persons exposed to excessive noise levels.
: the difficulties are linked, inter alia, to different data collection methods, qualities and data availability and methods used.
, this is the cause of various results in EU Member States. This is the cause of various results in the EU Member States.
, at the same time, the comparability level will eventually lead the harmonisation of methods(s) which will reflect the sectoral specifications sufficiently reflect the required level of comparability.
, in 2008, the Commission started working on the development of harmonised noise exposure methods (as referred to in Article 6(2)).
: "CNOSSOS-EU" project (Common noise evaluation methods in Europe) which leads the Joint Research Centre, shall ensure the technical basis for preparing the Commission Implementing Decision.
. If the technical work could be completed in 2011, the Commission considers possible revision of Annex II to the Rural Media Directive 2012 (the Committee will issue an opinion in 2011).
-collected methodological framework could concentrate on strategic mapping and would need to carefully balances the needs of harmonisation of adequacy and sectoral specifications, such as data requirements.
. In this Decision, the Commission intends to propose a joint work programme of the Commission/European Environmental Environmental Agency/Member States aimed at implementing the CNOSSOS-EU project for 2012-2015, to make this project functional for the third cycle of reporting in 2017.
: Developments of EU Directives The number of aspects of the Directive has not been detailed or leaves space for different interpretation and implementation.
. Many Member States have proposed that these issues be addressed through a specific action that will help implement and compliance with EU level, e.g. the development of documents with guidance, exchange of information on best practices or organising special workshops and training courses.
ing such actions could focus on these issues: mapping and best mapping methods, forecast values for noise maps, relationships between dose and reaction, calculation of repeated exposure, the formation of action plans and admissible or target values.

: creating a legal and fiscal environment which is favourable for businesses In order to benefit from all opportunities offered by the Single Market, including freedom of establishment, rules must be based on the single market, simple, adapted and must match the issues faced by businesses in the daily activities.
. Measures proposed in this section include reducing administrative and regulatory burden, including positive impacts on growth and job creation[17].
: In this context, very specific initiatives will be adopted to ensure the interconnection of trade companies registers and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union.
, the essential questions are also fiscal issues.
-initiative tax credit or VAT should limit the administrative burden of undertakings and facilitate their cross-border activity.
, moreover, they deserve special attention to the defence and security sector, as they encourage development and growth throughout the economy as a result of their high-tech, innovation and know-how.
. 19 : The Commission will adopt initiatives to improve the coordination of national fiscal policies, in particular the proposal for a directive to create a common consolidated basis of taxation of companies (CZS) in 2011.
: 27 existing national taxation systems in the EU are large differences, creating significant fiscal barriers to cross-border business activities of society, or even that activity prevents.
, such fragmentation results in considerable market distortions and cost of putting into line with the rules.
. This concerns particularly SMEs, often the necessary means to overcome these deficiencies, and can deter them from developing on the single market.
: the introduction of a common consolidated company taxation base is to address the problem of fiscal provisions which limit growth.
, companies groups should only be managed in fiscal matters only by a single set of rules and should act only with one fiscal governance across the EU (‘single Contact Point’).
, the recovery should be consolidated at group level and losses should be deducted from profits irrespective of the border.
, the case of double taxation or double exemption from tax due to differences or incompatibility between national fiscal rules would be excluded in intra-group relations.
, uncoordinated national measures would only be a situation of the current, since society would still be confronted with so many fiscal systems, as many States in which these companies operate.
. 107 In this context, it should be noted that Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1515/2001 provides that, if the dispute resolution authority adopts a report concerning non-contested measures, the Council may, if it considers appropriate, annul or amend the contested measures or adopt other appropriate measures to take account of the legal interpretations in it.
. According to recital 5 of that regulation, EU institutions may consider appropriate to repeal or amend measures adopted under the basic Regulation, including those not subject to dispute resolution proceedings under the Memorandum Agreement on rules and procedures governing dispute resolution or adopt other specific measures taking into account the legal interpretation contained in the report adopted by the dispute resolution authority.
) (iii) (iii) (iii) the provisions of EU law must be interpreted as far as possible in the light of international law, particularly where the objective of those provisions is to implement an international agreement concluded by the Community, such as that in the case of the basic Regulation, which was adopted to meet international obligations arising from the anti-dumping agreement (see recital 3 of the basic Regulation).

. 42 By notifying Article 2 of the decision on the comparative criteria for the choice of procedural conditions to be complied with, according to the appellant’s appellant’s decision, the Court of First Instance wrongly stated that the regulatory procedure can only be applied to measures with general scope.
– Arguments of the Commission 43 The Commission considers that the reference to recital 10 to recital 35 of Regulation No 319/94 is not relevant for the purposes of interpreting Article 1(3) of this Regulation, which imposes a specific duty, provided that two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of indirect invoicing and imports of ZAP.
. 44 As regards Article 2 of the Decision on the comparative part of the Commission contests the CMF’s argument that the Court of First Instance stated that the regulatory procedure can only be applied to measures with general scope.

. 47 As the Advocate General points out in paragraph 41 of his Opinion, both parts of the examination reason of the appeal are more specifically raised within the fourth, third ground of appeal, which is contested by the Court of First Instance’s own legal analysis.
. 48 Those parts of the appeal therefore correspond to the fourth, respecting the third ground of appeal.
: 49 Consequently, it is not necessary to examine them separately.
: For the ground of appeal alleging distortion of the factual framework Arguments of the parties – Arguments of the appellants 50 CMF claims that the Court of First Instance, in paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, adopted a completely fictional legal structure of the competent national authorities concerning the existence of indirect invoicing.
: 51 This presentation is incomplete and incorrect and therefore leads to distortion of the facts.

) It must be held that the Court of First Instance stated, first, that the overall impression which creates the mark applied for is dominated by the element ‘creaciones kennya’, which the consumer concerned will focus its attention to the broad extent and, second, in particular, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal that ‘ck’ element in relation to the ‘creaciones kennya’ element is merely an intervener, which essentially implies that the element ‘ck’ is negligible in the trade mark applied for.
: 58 The Court of First Instance, which, on the basis of the correct analysis, excluded any similarity between the marks of conflicting marks and marks, in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, that, despite the good name of earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.
: 59 Third part of the first ground of appeal must therefore be declared unfounded.
: 60 In those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
: For the second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, when he did not examine the good name of earlier marks within that provision.
: 62 The Court of First Instance held that the appellant claims that the applicant claims a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, whereas the action was specifically based on infringement of Article 8(5) of that regulation.
: 63 The Court of First Instance made an error of law when it found that, since the conflicting trade mark was similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of earlier marks.
. The fact that the earlier mark of Calvin Klein is generally known should be taken into account in the appellant for determining whether more extensive protection should be granted to it.
: Good name of the earlier mark must be assessed in assessing similarity between the marks and not after the similarity has been demonstrated.
. 64 In that regard, the appellant claims that if the prolific trade mark is protected only if the third parties ‘cK’ would have used the same way of graphical formation, it would mean that the CK trade mark with good name would be granted a level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection which would have enjoyed if it were not generally known.
: the fact that the mark of cK and other different graphic graphic formation of those letters are famous, confers protection against the use of the ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, since that letter identifies Calvin Klein in that sector, so that their use of a third party produces confusion through association.
. 65 OHIM argues that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance has lawfully held the issue of the earlier mark’s good name in the judgment under appeal.
. Since the contested sign cannot be regarded as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 does not apply.
. 66 Zafra Marroquineros states that in the judgment under appeal, the reference to the good name of earlier marks is made.

, however, he did not provide any evidence that he would have been in fact worked on the basis of this contract.
. 22 By decision of 21 January 2009, Mr O rejected the applicant’s request for residence permission, which was submitted to him, with the reasoning that Mr O. had no sufficient revenue.
, in the present case, there was no reason to derogate from the conditions relating to the life-related assets as provided for in Article 39(1) of the Civilian Law, in the event of particularly serious circumstances or require the best interests of the child.
: 23 By judgment of 27 August 2009, Helsingin hallinto-oikeus (the Administrative Court in Helsinki) dismissed the action for annulment brought by Mr O. against that rejective decision.
Ms S. and Mr O. lodged an appeal against that judgment in appeal to Korkein hallinto-oikeus (Supreme Administrative Court).

. It is necessary to lay down detailed rules for the implementation of this system.
.Control checks may be completed prior to receipt of payment and annual premiums pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receiving them.
. In particular, where such checks cannot be completed before receiving such payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of administrative sanctions should be enforced in accordance with this Regulation or starting.
, rules should be laid down in the Member States responsible for the system of control of the duty on conditionality obligations.
, minimum checks should be set to determine the minimum level of control for the verification of the conditionality obligation.
. This control rate should be set at least 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 which fall within the scope of the relevant control authorities and which must be selected on the basis of an appropriate risk analysis.
. For the purpose of calculating the control sample, persons in particular case of a group of persons under Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, flexibility should be provided to the Member States in determining whether they will assess the group as a whole or each member individually.
. Member States should be able to choose whether to meet the minimum level of control at the level of each competent control body, at the level of paying agencies or at the level of the act or standards or to set of acts or standards.
. If the specific legislation applicable to acts or standards lays down minimum checks, Member States should respect these rates.
, however, Member States should be authorised to use a uniform level of on-the-spot checks on conditionality.
. If Member States choose this option, all cases of mismatch detected during on-the-spot checks should be reported and followed under conditionality.
. In order to simplify the obligations relating to the conditionality of Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the application of a specific level of sampling from monitoring plans should be considered to be fulfilling the minimum requirement laid down in this Regulation.
. Member States should be provided with flexibility necessary to achieve minimum control rates by using results from other on-the-spot checks or by replacing beneficiaries.
. In order to avoid weakening the control system, in particular as regards sampling for on-the-spot checks, the minimum control sample calculation should not be taken into account the subsequent checks carried out in relation to the de minimis rule as referred to in Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
: detection of significant degree of non-compliance in connection with conditionality should lead to an increase in on-the-spot checks in order to achieve an acceptable level of security in relation to the correctness of the applications concerned for support.

: Analysis of basic factors and the fact that the reference value is complied with broad spread, confirms a positive outcome on price stability criteria.
, in addition to Lithuania, this criterion still exists Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Sweden.
: public debt and deficit amount Na Lithuania is currently not subject to Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit (as referred to in Article 126(6) of the Treaty).
, the general government deficit ratio fell from 5,5% in 2011 to 2.1% in 2013 and the Commission's economic forecasts from spring 2014 is to remain at 2.1% in 2014, in 2014, respectively.
, the total public debt at the end of 2013 was 39.4% of GDP – that is significantly less than the Maastricht League.
. This criterion also meet Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Sweden.
. Czech Republic will also meet this criterion if the Council decides to abolish the excessive deficit procedure as proposed by the Commission.
. Two Member States (Croatia and Poland) are currently subject to a excessive deficit procedure and that criterion therefore do not meet.
: Exchange rate stability In the mechanism of exchange rates II (ERM II) is a exchange rate of a Member State not a member of the euro area, established on the euro and may be varied only within the limits (standard fluctuation zone  ⁇ 15 % from the medium course).
. Lithuania is a member of ERM II since 28 June 2004.
, no pressure was exposed to any pressure during the two-year reference period and no deviation from the ERM II Central Course.
, this criterion does not meet any other country, since currently no other Member State is a member of ERM II.
