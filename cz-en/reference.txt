However, no alternatives were provided by any interested party.
The revision is based on the revised capacity data provided by the complainant, covering the entire Union industry.
The revised data was cross-referenced to publicly available data concerning in particular idle capacity as well as capacity of producers that ceased operations due to financial difficulties.
As explained above in section 6, ‘Macroeconomic indicators’, the revised data provide a more accurate dataset of capacity available to produce biodiesel during the period under consideration than the dataset originally provided and published in the provisional Regulation.

It was to be a test...
Samah gazed at Xar in earnest appeal.
That was all.
A difficult test.
One meant to teach you humility, patience.
One meant to diminish your aggression..."
"Weaken us," Xar said softly.
"Yes," said Samah, slowly lowering his head.
"Weaken you."
"You feared us."
"We feared you."
"You hoped we would die..."
"No."
Samah shook his head.
"The Labyrinth became the embodiment of that hope.

And did someone ever sang it to you?
Everyone.
Pretty Rebecca, Queen of the Promenade, that's what they used to call me!

After all, he'd just been in Paris that afternoon, killing time and waiting for a meet with a former "colleague" in DGSE.
"When is decided, then?"
"Yes, you have the date, Dmitriy."
"I know whom to see and whom to call to arrange the meeting."
"You have to do it face-to-face?" the American asked, rather stupidly, Popov thought.
A gentle laugh.
"My dear friend, yes, face-to-face.

"That's a risk."
"Only a small one.

The third question concerns the attributability of the concerted practices.
Essentially, the question is whether the Commission was entitled to attribute liability for the infringement committed by another undertaking to TKS on the basis of a unilateral statement made by TKS.
I shall also make clear that a public authority such as the Commission, which has responsibility for ensuring application of the principles set out in Article 81 EC, cannot derogate from the rules and principles governing attributability in relation to concerted practices on the basis of private agreements concluded by undertakings.

They had dismounted and were seated in a circle around two officers.
Janus wished he had a long-glass to study the situation more closely.
It seemed to him that one of the M if officers had a pistol in his hand and that the barrel was in his mouth.

"Barbarians," Kessell guessed.
But it didn't matter to him, and why should it?
He had all that he needed right here in Cryshal-Tirith and had no desire to travel anywhere else.
No desires that were wrought of his own will.
Crenshinibon was a relic that was truly alive in its magic.
And part of its life was the desire to conquer and command.
It wanted more.
It wanted power.
Kessell's own subconscious recollections of Ten-Towns when he had spotted the column of smoke had stirred the relic's hunger, so it now used the same empathetic power of suggestion on Kessell.
A sudden image grasped at the wizard's deepest needs.
He saw himself seated on a throne in Bryn Shander, immeasurably wealthy and respected by all in his court.
He imagined the response from the Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan when the mages there, especially Eldulac and Dendybar, learned of Akar Kessell, Lord of Ten-Towns and Ruler of all Icewind Dale!
Would they offer him a robe in their puny order then?
Despite Kessell's true enjoyment of the leisurely existence he had found, the thought appealed to him.
He let his mind continue through the fantasy, exploring the paths that he might take to accomplish such an ambitious goal.
The European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, as a headline target, aims to increase the average healthy lifespan in the EU by two years by 2020.
It seeks to improve older people's quality of life and to lead to more efficient care solutions.
It will focus on applying innovation on a larger scale than today in areas such as health promotion, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, integrated and collaborative health and social care systems, independent living and assistive technologies for older people.
The Commission will analyse the responses to the consultation, in order to obtain a clear view of the innovation potential and capacity in the multiple areas that affect ageing today.
The responses will help the Commission to plan the next steps for the EIP.
The online consultation runs in parallel to a Conference on the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, which is taking place in Brussels today.
More than 150 stakeholder representatives are due to discuss their ideas for the partnership to convert into concrete actions.
Background The European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing is part of the EU's "Innovation Union" strategy, one of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives, to turn ideas into jobs, green growth and social progress (IP/10/1288).
The Innovation Union has a three-fold goal: making Europe into a world-class science performer; revolutionising the way public and private sectors work together, notably through Innovation Partnerships, and removing bottlenecks – like expensive patenting, market fragmentation, slow standard setting and skill shortages - that currently prevent ideas getting quickly to market.
This corresponds to the Digital Agenda for Europe's objective to harness the potential of ICT to boost prosperity and improve people's quality of life (see IP/10/581, MEMO/10/199 and MEMO/10/200).

In Asia, regional cooperation initiatives on nutrition should be reinforced.
Harmonising EU interventions The EU approach to food security in developing countries needs to be anchored in the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the Accra Agenda for Action, as well as in the EU Code of Conduct on Division of Labour.
The EU and its Member States should identify regions and countries where tasks will be divided based on comparative advantage and coordinate actions under the guidance of a lead donor.
Both the EU and its Member States have several policy frameworks and financing instruments to assist partner countries in coping with food insecurity.
Greater harmonisation of policies and greater complementarity of instruments, as well as coordination with private investments, should lead to more effective action.
Policy Coherence for Development[26] (PCD) on food security will be promoted through a range of policy instruments, including agriculture, trade, fisheries, climate change, environment and research.
Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has enhanced coherence, and future reforms will continue to take global food security objectives into account.
Future reform of the Common Fisheries Policy will further increase coherence between Europe's fishing policies and practices and development objectives.
Finally, a balanced, comprehensive and ambitious conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda would strengthen the international trading system, with beneficial effects on food security.
Improving the coherence of the international governance system The EU and its Member States should enhance the coherence of international food security governance and support the rapid reform of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) as the central body on food security.
The reformed CFS should aim to obtain an oversight role in other specific domains with implications for food security, including food aid and nutrition.
There is a need to further rationalise the priorities of the three Rome-based UN agencies (FAO, WFP, IFAD) and improve their cooperation to create synergies.
The reform of the UN system and the ongoing review of the role and priorities of FAO offer opportunities to improve quality and effectiveness.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION
PRESS RELEASE
Brussels, 16 December 2013
The European Commission today adopted "Shift2Rail", a new public-private partnership to invest just under €1 billion in research and innovation to get more passengers and freight onto Europe's railways.
Rail is amongst the most efficient and climate-friendly forms of transport, but currently it only carries about only 10% of European cargo and 6% of passengers each year.

My brother was shot in broad daylight.
The police took their time.
They caught some guys and I identified them.
I told them to their faces:
"That's them". They arrested them for murder.
But after three months they were freed.
They looked for me and they found me.
Who gave them my address?
They broke three of my ribs, my collarbone, all the fingers on this hand.
My retina was detached.

Vessels concerned by fishing effort limitations A Member State shall not permit fishing with a gear belonging to a grouping of fishing gear defined in point 3 in the area by any of its vessels which have no record of such fishing activity in the years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 or 2006 in the area, excluding the record of fishing activities as a result of transfer of days between fishing vessels, unless it ensures that equivalent capacity, measured in kilowatts, is prevented from fishing in the regulated area.
However, a vessel with a track record of using a gear belonging to a grouping of fishing gear defined in point 3 may be authorised to use a different fishing gear , provided that the number of days allocated to this latter gear is greater than or equal to the number of days allocated to the first gear.
A vessel flying the flag of a Member State having no quotas in the area defined in point 1 shall not be permitted to fish in that area with a gear belonging to a grouping of fishing gear defined in point 3, unless the vessel is allocated a quota after a transfer as permitted according to the Article 20(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 and is allocated days at sea according to point 13 of this Annex.
For vehicles with an axle-lift device, the effect of this device shall be taken into account.
‘Technically permissible maximum mass on the axle (m)’ means the mass corresponding to the maximum permissible static vertical load exerted by the axle on the road surface, based on the construction of the vehicle and of the axle and as stated by the vehicle manufacturer.
‘Technically permissible maximum mass on a group of axles (μ)’ means the mass corresponding to the maximum permissible static vertical load exerted by the group of axles on the road surface, based on both the construction of the vehicle and of the group of axles and as stated by the vehicle manufacturer.
‘Towable mass’ means the total load exerted on the road surface by the axle(s) of the towed vehicle(s).
‘Technically permissible maximum towable mass (TM)’ means the maximum towable mass stated by the manufacturer.
‘Technically permissible maximum mass on the coupling point of a vehicle’ means the mass corresponding to the maximum permissible static vertical load on the coupling point based on the construction of the vehicle and/or coupling device and as stated by the manufacturer.
‘Technically permissible maximum laden mass of the combination (MC)’ means the total mass of a combination of vehicle and trailer(s) as stated by the manufacturer.
It is not necessary for the parties in the case to raise the question; the national court may do so of its own motion.
References on interpretation Any court or tribunal may refer a question to the Court on the interpretation of a rule of Community law if it considers it necessary to do so in order to resolve a dispute brought before it.
However, courts or tribunals against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law must, as a rule, refer such a question to the Court, unless the Court has already ruled on the point (and there is no new context that raises any serious doubt as to whether that case-law may be applied), or unless the correct interpretation of the rule of Community law is obvious.
Thus, a court or tribunal against whose decisions there is a judicial remedy may, in particular when it considers that sufficient clarification is given by the case-law of the Court, itself decide on the correct interpretation of Community law and its application to the factual situation before it.
However, a reference for a preliminary ruling may prove particularly useful, at an appropriate stage of the proceedings, when there is a new question of interpretation of general interest for the uniform application of Community law throughout the Union, or where the existing case-law does not appear to be applicable to a new set of facts.
It is for the national court to explain why the interpretation sought is necessary to enable it to give judgment.
References on determination of validity Although national courts may reject pleas raised before them challenging the validity of Community acts, the Court has exclusive jurisdiction to declare such acts invalid.
All national courts must therefore refer a question to the Court when they have doubts about the validity of a Community act, stating the reasons for which they consider that the Community act may be invalid.
If a national court has serious doubts about the validity of a Community act on which a national measure is based, it may exceptionally suspend application of that measure temporarily or grant other interim relief with respect to it.
It must then refer the question of validity to the Court of Justice, stating the reasons for which it considers the Community act to be invalid.
The stage at which to submit a question for a preliminary ruling A national court or tribunal may refer a question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling as soon as it finds that a ruling on the point or points of interpretation or validity is necessary to enable it to give judgment; it is the national court which is in the best position to decide at what stage of the proceedings such a question should be referred.
It is, however, desirable that a decision to seek a preliminary ruling should be taken when the proceedings have reached a stage at which the national court is able to define the factual and legal context of the question, so that the Court has available to it all the information necessary to check, where appropriate, that Community law applies to the main proceedings.
It may also be in the interests of justice to refer a question for a preliminary ruling only after both sides have been heard.
The form of the reference for a preliminary ruling The decision by which a national court or tribunal refers a question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling may be in any form allowed by national law as regards procedural steps.
It must however be borne in mind that it is that document which serves as the basis of the proceedings before the Court and that it must therefore contain such information as will enable the latter to give a reply which is of assistance to the national court.

No, not the Ned part, unless you want to.
I meant your last name. I thought you might like to let me give you mine.
Or if you want to, you can change the first part, too.
I would have named you Kingsley if I'd had a say in it.

Horcrux.
I came across the term while reading... ...and I didn't fully understand it.
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom... ...but this is very dark stuff,very dark indeed.
A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
But I don't understand how that works, sir.
One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.
By doing so, you're protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.
Protected?
That part of your soul that is hidden lives on.
In other words, you cannot die.
And how does one split his soul, sir?

Following the First World War, both Austria and Germany became republics, abolishing the nobility and all the privileges and titles pertaining thereto.
For Austrian nationals, it has been unlawful since then, as a matter of constitutional law, to bear any title of nobility, a prohibition which extends to the use of such particles as ‘von’ or ‘zu’ as part of a surname.
In Germany, however, a different approach was taken: existing titles, although they could no longer be borne as such, became part of the family surname, transmitted to all children, subject only to variations according to the sex of the child where an element has both a masculine and a feminine form – for example Fürst (Prince) and Fürstin (Princess).

‘PART 2 Model health certificate for imports of consignments of ova and embryos of animals of the ovine and caprine species EN Official Journal of the European Union L 252/s3 NOTE TO READERS — WAY OF REFERRING TO ACTS As of 1 July 2013 the way of referring to acts has changed.
During a transitional period this new practice will coexist with the previous one.
The achievement of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) should not be undermined by Member States violating CFP rules.
Pursuant to Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) , financial assistance from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) is made conditional upon compliance with CFP rules by Member States.
Non-compliance by Member States with the CFP rules may result in the interruption or suspension of payments or in the application of a financial correction to Union financial assistance under the CFP.
Articles 83(1) and 142(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) set out the conditions under which interruption of a payment deadline or suspension of payments may be imposed, respectively.
Those two Articles foresee that the fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down specific bases for interruption and suspension linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the CFP.
In order to safeguard the financial interests of the Union and its taxpayers, where a Member State has failed to comply with its obligations under the CFP, or where the Commission has evidence that suggests such a lack of compliance, the Commission is allowed, as a precautionary measure, to interrupt payment deadlines pursuant to Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.
In addition to the interruption of the payment deadline, and in order to avoid the risk of paying out ineligible expenditure, the Commission is allowed, pursuant to Article 101 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, to suspend payments in cases of serious non-compliance with the CFP rules.
Financial consequences imposed on Member States if they do not comply with CFP rules should be proportionate to the nature, gravity, duration and repetition of the non-compliance.
In order to provide legal certainty for Member States implementing operational programmes under the EMFF, it is necessary to define the cases of non-compliance with CFP rules essential to the conservation of marine biological resources that may trigger interruption of the payment deadline or suspension of payments in line with Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.
Those cases will serve the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 and implement Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 without prejudice to any other sanctions imposed by CFP rules.
Cases of non-compliance with CFP rules that are essential to the conservation of marine biological resources should be considered as serious, if the Member State has failed to take the necessary action to remedy the situation giving rise to an interruption of the payment deadline.
Prior to the interruption or suspension of payments, the Commission has to adopt implementing acts pursuant to Articles 100(2) and 101(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 that will further specify the non-compliance of the Member State with its obligations under the CFP rules that is liable to affect the expenditure for which the interim payment is requested.
Given the importance of ensuring that there is a harmonised and equal treatment of operators in all Member States from the start of the programming period, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union , HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1 Cases of non-compliance The cases of non-compliance by a Member State with its obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), that may trigger the interruption of the payment deadline for an interim payment claim pursuant to Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, are set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

She looked unobtrusively about her as she strode along, trying to get the feel of the new area.

They were indecently rich, had a finger in every political pie, and, as a class, showed all the ethical restraint of a shark in a feeding frenzy.
Having reached the pinnacle of their profession, their ambition turned in the only direction left to them, and they set their sights on the Quality.
Even in Haven, the poorest aristocrat could still look down his nose at the richest trader.
So, in recent times certain wealthy merchant families had been negotiating marriage contracts with the more impoverished Quality Families, quite openly offering to pay off a Family's debts in return for marriage into the Quality.

If the 10-year limitation period for APSA started running only when the vaccine was transferred to the Department of Health, the precise date of the sale of the vaccine by APMSD to the Department of Health would have to be ascertained, in order to determine the starting date of the limitation period.
Leaving aside the question whether in that case the 10-year limitation period in relation to APSA would not already have been interrupted by the bringing of the action against APMSD, ( 36 ) the proceedings brought against APSA on 16 October 2002 would in any event have been initiated before the expiry of the 10-year period if the vaccine was not put into circulation until a sale to the Department of Health on or after 16 October 1992. ( 37 ) 90.
Even if the precise time of the sale of the vaccine to the Department of Health which started the period running could no longer be ascertained, but could merely be confined to the period between 22 September 1992 – the date when the vaccine was received by APMSD – and 3 November 1992 – the vaccination of the respondent – the bringing of the action against APSA on 16 October 2002 would in any case have interrupted the limitation period in good time.
If APSA put forward a limitation defence, it would have to prove the date of putting the vaccine into circulation.
( 38 ) If APSA as producer could merely confine that date to a certain period starting more than 10 years before the date of bringing proceedings but ending less than 10 years before that date, APSA as producer would bear the burden of proving and the associated risk of not proving the precise point at which time started running.
( 39 ) In the absence of a precise determination of the time of putting into circulation, the proceedings of 16 October 2002 would in such a case too have been brought against APSA in time in any event, thus interrupting the limitation period against APSA.

In my view, that recital clearly confirms that it is sufficient, for Article 2 of the regulation (which is identical to that of the Convention) to be applicable, for the defendant to be domiciled in a Member State bound by that regulation, so that the dispute concerned displays a link with one of the Member States of the Community.
It is therefore of scant importance that the dispute in question may not display an additional link with another Member State, or displays such a link with a non-member State.

Then while he went hauwwww hauwww hauwww like a doggie I tried the same style as for Georgie, banking all on one move - up, cross, cut - and I felt the britva go just deep enough in the meat of old Dim's wrist and he dropped his snaking oozy yelping like a little child.
Needs somethin'.
Just stop.
Stop what?
You get drunk.
Bring 'em all.
No.
The more, the merrier.
Yeah.
(Juliette) All right, guys, we're gonna go through the set list plus an additional song that I added for tonight.
This is my friend Savannah.
Hey.
Hi.
We can still make it to our cars!
Come on!
We don't know how far it's spread.
It's safer inside!
Where's Lissy?
I think she's at the pool.
Take Jen.
Get her inside!
All of you inside now!
Come on!
Take care of them.
I'll go get Lissy.
Move, move.
Come on!
Chlorine gas.
After I reveal my tale to you, everything will become crystal clear.
I found out my parents were...
Things were going well, until she wanted to... and then I was all: "no way" and she was all: "yes way" and I was like...
Gallahxar's out.
Ok. Boys, set the terror level at code brown cause I need to change my pants.
Gallahxar, command you to hand over the prisoner this instant.
Watch out!
Wow, look out brainless.
All aliens, destroy all monsters.
You want some of this?
You wanna hurt my friend. You'll have to go through me.
A hexadecimal colorcode system.
This won't be, but a moment.
Ok.
Give me that!
That would be nice.
Boring.
You better stay in the car.
Should I pee in the car?
Okay, go ahead.
Hold on.
Why?
You should try to be cheerful instead of so serious.
It is important to see the positive as you said, yes, right?
I do not know me and it does not matter.
First you tell me that I'm dark and gloomy and now you tell me not to be happy?
There!
When I was not hungry. I was thirsty.
You leave it here.
But I like the minivan.
It's roomy.
I appreciate that but, as it's a stolen minivan... .. it's probably better that you leave it here.
How long you gonna do this, Eddie ?
The kids are worried sick about you.
But still you go out, night after night, running around the city for what ?
Lucille, God gave me a gift .
I shovel very well.
All l-- Oh, no, no, no.
You're right.
I believe in you, Daddy.
Roland, do not encourage your father.
I was innocent, but the church decided to transfer me. Said it would be easier for all involved.
When the parishioners at the new church got wind of why I'd been transferred, they were unhappy.
Okay, you wanted to know why I moved around so much, and I told you.
You're a wuss—part wimp, part puss.
What about the friend who has two tickets to see Brubeck at the blue note? –I thought you had an orgy planned. –I lied.
There's H.R. There're Cuddy.
I'm not saying you're codependent.
You know what?
So you want to quit? No, I want to stop a stupid stunt.
House doesn't want either one of us to quit.
Nothing. –cool. –It's cool he's a child molester?
It's cool the priest doesn't believe in God.
It's cool that God did to him what he did to the kid.
Allegedly. –You think he's innocent? –He had honest eyes?
Your father used to scare the crap out of me.
Mm-hmm. Well, evidently not enough to keep you from sneaking in at 3:00 in the morning.
I didn't know whether to punish you or make you pancakes.
Hey, hey! Ha ha ha ha!
Halfway through dinner, I told Claire that whenever she had the urge to lash out at her mother, she should just squeeze my hand instead.
A doctor had to cut off my wedding ring.
Claire, you remember that time we cut school - and we went out to the pier...
Mm-hmm. ...And we played that game, and you won the...
Giant panda bear!
Okay, I think we're... we're done.
Yeah, well, I better get going.
I've got an early-morning run, celebrity client.
Don't ask me who. Let's just say that if I'm late, I'll be in Jeopardy.
You know what hurt more? What?
I used to think your mother loved me.

What happened to you, Anna?
The project has a turtle rehabilitation centre and for the last two years, it's become home to Shella.
It was a hit from behind.
She lost three ribs and her spine was damaged.
She's healed well and to encourage her to exercise her flippers properly, she has, every day, a little trip to the seaside.
She gets an opportunity to eat her natural food.
We believe it keeps her fit and the other thing is, she gets to use her rear flippers quite often.
For Kahindi, it's one of the rewards for all his hard work.
It's really enjoyable.
Very few people have the privilege like I do of swimming with the turtles and having that fun.
Shella certainly did get stronger, but the hope that some day she might swim out in the open was not to be fulfilled.
Unaccountably, she become weaker and eventually died.
This kind of work will inevitably have setbacks.
But there are always new turtles to be cared for.
Is she healthy?
We won, dude!
We won!
You OK?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm pushing.
You better be.
I'm pushing!
Push harder!

Interested parties who have come forward pursuant to Article 3(6)(b) and representatives of the Central American country concerned may, upon written request, inspect all information made available to the Commission in connection with the investigation other than internal documents prepared by the Union authorities or those of the Member States, provided that that information is relevant to the presentation of their case and not confidential within the meaning of Article 11 and that it is used by the Commission in the investigation.
Interested parties who have come forward may communicate their views on the information to the Commission.
Those views shall be taken into consideration where they are backed by sufficient prima facie evidence.

Good night.
There was indeed an overlap of the IPs in the two proceedings.
However, this overlapping period was limited to the first three months of the IP for the current proceeding.
In accordance with Article 6(1) of the basic Regulation, for a representative finding, the IP should normally cover a period of six months immediately prior to the initiation of the proceeding.
In these circumstances it was considered that data from the first three months of the IP would not be sufficiently representative for the seasonal and volatile AN market.
In addition, it should be stressed that using information received in the context of a given proceeding for a precise purpose, in another proceeding for a different purpose, where the party concerned has moreover expressed its unwillingness to cooperate with the second investigation, would be contrary to the provisions of Article 19(6) of the basic Regulation.

Yeah, if you start shooting, the Marines will attack.
Then it's your job to make sure I don't die in vain, isn't it?
Snipers have a shot.
Nikita, please.
I have nothing left.
If you die, I die.
All right.
All right, we'll do it your way.
Thank you.
Stand the snipers down.
Ok.
Birkhoff will open a data channel.
Transfer the file through it.
Once we receive the file, the Marines will back off, and then you can come out peacefully.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's going on here?
Nothing, Mom.
We was just fooling, right?
I saw what was going on.
Go on, Stanley.
Teach him a lesson.
Hit him back.
Yeah, teach me a lesson.

Then she heard VanHorn say, "We've got to go now."
While Watkins drove, VanHorn put one of the cartridges in the syringe, then jammed the needle into his thigh.
He jammed the second into his forearm just above the bite marks.
He hoped the shots would keep him alive until he reached the emergency room.
Soon the allergic reaction made his veins dilate and his blood pressure drop.
Breathing became difficult.
I have to live, he said to himself.
He slumped in his seat.
Watkins grabbed his hair and yanked his head back to keep his airway open.
"Hang in there," she said.
She held him that way, steering at 75 m.p.h. with her left hand.
First get the antidote started in the emergency room.
Stand back, please!

Take your coat? -Yes.
So, Lucy Hill, this is Ted Mitchell.
Oh, so it's a whole dinner party. -Oh, yeah.
Lovely.
So, Ted, do you live around here?
Yeah.
Yeah, I moved up here. Little over 1 0 years ago.
But the fact that the battery was firing showed that they must at least be almost in range — they were circling on the very edge of ruin.
Nevertheless, the Sutherland was making better speed through the water, and looking aft he could see preparations advancing on the Pluto's deck for setting up a jury main mast.
Any fragment of sail which the Pluto could carry would ease the Sutherland's task enormously, and in an hour they might have the work completed.
If you almost die by noon, you're pretty ready for a date at 6:00 p.m.
Ooh, I hear that.
But...
My experience... the same risks that bring you together end up weighing too much for anything long term.
Here's to plowing ahead anyway.
Cheers.
Let me see a twirl!
Oh, yeah.
No, you're doing fine.
Keep teaching your brother.
Okay.
Hello.
What's the prognosis?
I got to wear this stupid thing a couple weeks.
You know what puts you on that ledge?
That provision is merely a reproduction of a commitment proposed by DSD in the context of the administrative proceedings (recitals 63 and 133 of the contested decision).
DSD cannot therefore claim, in the context of the current proceedings, that a solution other than that which DSD itself proposed to the Commission now constitutes a more appropriate solution to address the problem identified during the proceedings.
In addition, to accept the solution advocated by the applicant, namely the concealing of the Der Grüne Punkt logo rather than placing a note close to that logo would be akin to requiring packaging manufacturers to provide different types of packaging for each Member State, which would not be economically rational.
204 Consequently, the complaint alleging that Article 4(2) of the contested decision is disproportionate in so far as it requires the affixing of a note to packaging even though it would have been possible to conceal the Der Grüne Punkt logo must be rejected.
So poor old Dim, masked like Peebee Shelley, had a good loud smeck at that, roaring like some animal.
"It's a book," I said.
Come on.
Unfortunately, it also happens to be true.
At least now it's over.
I must go.
Keep in touch!
Okay.
It's a little late for that," Ritter said disgustedly.
This was the best op his Directorate had run in years, and the guy whose idea it had been was now wetting his pants.
Admiral Cutter wasn't paying enough attention to Ritter's invective to be angry.
He'd promised the President a surgical removal of the people who had killed Jacobs and the rest.
More importantly, neither had WRANGLER.
Chavez was too far south to have heard the explosion.

What's the rumpus?
Descended from headhunters.
What?
Been in this region for thousands of years.
Headhunters?
There's still some villages here.
Hold on, excuse me.
Did you say headhunters?
There haven't been practicing headhunters in Borneo for a century.
Just because they ain't practicing don't mean they don't remember how.
They must be along this branch of the river.
If we can find their village, maybe they can lend us a boat.
We just gonna walktowards the headhunters, not away?
Yeah.
I'm so hungry, I'd sellmy grandmother for a Tic Tac.

Yes, of course, Dr. Suresh.
It's okay, Alice.

Just focus on the cards.
I'm not reading your mind If that's what you think.
I had a dream about this, about you showing me cards. A dream?
About this exact moment?
And does everything you dream come true?
About you.
You're going to kill everybody here. My parents.
I can assure you... That's not going to happen. You are a good man.
And you've treated us with nothing but kindness. But I'm telling you
It's going to get out of your control.
If you leave, it destroys all our work. Don't you see the benefits

We're talking about a white man who shot three black men.

It was my fault.

The Commission’s capacity-building support therefore mainly focuses on PFM.
However, there is no clear link between the needs for improving PFM in a particular country and the amounts provided for capacity-building support.
It is therefore not clear that the share of GBS programme funding allocated to capacity-building, usually in the order of 5 %, is sufficient to have a significant impact.

Lower your weapons.
I... don't think so.
We will not allow you to take King Arkhan from us.
Good King Arkhan is a fraud.
Our king is wise.
He is a seer.
He may be your king, but he's no seer.
He can only interpret what's been written on pillars of the temple ruins.
Anyone whocan read them can make the predictions.
That is a lie!
Why don't we just go back to the village and let King Arkhan explain everything?
First, lower your weapons.
Jack?
Daniel?
They're not going to shoot.
I'm sorry.
I failed.
The heart wasn't strong enough.
Stop.
It's me.
Daniel.
Daniel?
Stop.
Just stop the pain.
How?
Just... let me go.
No.
No, I won't lose you again.
Daniel.
Daniel, come back to me.
She's gone.
Come on, dad.
Pick up, please.
Samuel.
Dad.
I found him on the hill...
With this!
Are you okay?
Claire, I didn't do it.
You murderer!
He's the one.
You brought him here.
No, don't hurt them.
We're better than this.
Take him to the house of mirrors.
Clara!
Watch out!
There's a rhinoceros loose in the bathroom!
Seriously, how dare you.
By which I mean the planet.
Unless things change, people.
Unless things change.
While you sat there watching us naked,
Did you ever even for just one second
Consider me attractive?
Oh, sure. There's an attraction.
What's the word, gravitational pull.
ha ha ha.
You're so funny.
Well, hero, I knew what you was up to.
Monsieur d’Igby—at least that was what he was called in Paris—was an Englishman Roberto had met at the Dupuys’, then found again one evening in a salon.
Less than three lustra had passed since the Due de Bou-quinquant had shown that an Englishman could have le ro-man en teste and be prone to well-bred madness.
Informed that there was in France a queen beautiful and haughty, to the dream of winning her he devoted his life, until he died of it.
Living for a long time on a ship, he erected an altar to his beloved.
When it was learned that d’lgby, actually as Bouquin-quant’s envoy, had fought a privateering war against Spain, the universe of the precieuses found him fascinating.
In the Dupuys’ circle the English were not popular: they were identified with characters like Robertus a Fluctibus, Med-icinae Doctor, Eques Auratus et Armiger Oxoniensis, against whom various pamphlets had been written, deprecating his excessive faith in the occult operations of nature.
If today were a normal day, there wouldn't have been any problems.
But...
I'd forgotten that today was an extremely unlucky day.
It's crazy... but I'm going to die.
This is it.
If I had known, I would have gotten up earlier.
Wouldn't have been late.
Avoid being knocked over by stupid boys.
And today was supposed to be NICE day...
Hey!
Are you blind or something?!
Apologize!
Apologize this very instant!
I'm sorry!
Who was she fucking?!
No one.

SHERWOOD : Good morning, Reagan High.
There will be a memorial service held for Elizabeth tomorrow at 2:00 at Cloverdale Lawn Rest Home.
And students, Mr. Murk, our guidance counselor, will be available for those of you suffering from distress.
My thoughts are with you.
Just tragic.
A beautiful, charismatic girl like Elizabeth Purr just struck down by the hand of fate.
If I had anything to do with her demise, I don't know what I'll do.
It'll be all right.
A neighbor said she saw a girl with schoolbooks come up to the house at 3:30 that day.
When I asked him why he made such a point of his 'green trees,' he told me, to my astonishment, that he had heard that last time I was in Pavlofsk I had said that I had come 'to have a last look at the trees.'
I'll still walk out of this joint, and then I'll take care of Big Ed.
And let him live that long?
No, Cody.
I'll take care of Big Ed.
No, Ma.
No one does what he's done to you, son, and gets away with it.
No, Ma.
I’m going after him to keep him from having you knocked off here.
I’m telling you, don't do it.
Goodbye, Cody.
Ma!
What's the matter, Parker?
Not now.
I’m going to let you stay awake nights... sweat it out.
I'll take care of Big Ed.
Did he see it?
Not really.
You good, little man?
Shut the door, please.
Sheriff Althea Jarry.

Chibs.
I didn't realize this was a family business.
This is a rare occurrence for us.
We run a legit, quiet business here.
We're rich!
How'd you get this?
Boxing.
Did you win?
Yes, ma'am.
What do you get for winning?
Respect.
So why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect?
They made me a cook.
I, uh,clean up after other sailors eat.
Two years, they never even let me fire a weapon.
You, too, ma'am.
You know, he taught me to fly.
He'd be there with me.
Up there, he was always pushing me to be better and faster.
Downing and Gates.
We got to let them in.
We got a marching band on Downing and Gates...
Throw them up.

European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries in Eastern Europe and the Southern Caucasus 2.2.1.
Current framework for dialogue The framework for relations with the countries of Eastern Europe and the Southern Caucasus is the ENP.
Although indirectly mentioned in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (PCAs), which form the legal basis of the EC's relationship with these countries, cooperation on migration, visa issues, asylum, border management and other related economic and social issues feature in all of the ENP Action Plans which have been agreed with eastern partners.
Some of these partner countries also have their own National Action Programme on these issues.
In the case of Ukraine, there is a separate JLS Action Plan – which is equivalent to that section of the Action Plans agreed with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova – and the Commission is also working with Ukraine on the basis of a scoreboard, based on the JLS Action Plan, which contains benchmarks.
Migration issues are already discussed in depth with Moldova and Ukraine in relevant sub-committees and are also raised at the regular EU-Ukraine JLS ministerial troika as well as during meetings of the Cooperation Committee and Cooperation Council.
A similar approach is followed in the case of the three Southern Caucasus countries whose Action Plans were adopted in November 2006.
With each country, dialogue and cooperation progress at a different pace based on their capacity, size (particularly relevant in the case of Ukraine) and situation.
While Belarus is a case apart[7], technical cooperation on matters relating to border issues, migration and organised crime is possible on the basis of working-level contacts with Belarusian officials and within the framework of regional dialogue and programmes.

But you would do that, right? - Of course.
We're ready to begin work on the DHD.
You're sure about this? Positive.
We'll show you beyond the pale!
Suck on this!
You ready?
Hold, please!
I-I'm tapped.
Carmen?
All right.
Hecklers rest!
Thank you.
It's a valiant effort, Mr. Infeld.
But this nonsense, while annoying, in no way affects my ability to do my job.
Are you certain, your honor?
Because I-I see the veins in your neck.
Fan passion bordering on Vitriol is as old as the game, so tell your client to get his panties out of a wad and play a little baseball.

We're getting close.
Anyone?
Come on. It's fun.
You hapless toads are utterly clueless, aren't you?
I-I-I got a wife and kids.
And my mother, you've met.
Dean, everything you just said is completely true.
Dean?

No! Yes.
How is Kevin a Prophet if Chuck is a Prophet?

Fight against doping Doping remains an important threat to sport.
Use of doping substances by amateur athletes poses serious public health hazards and calls for preventive action, including in fitness centres.
Doping prevention and doping sanctions remain within the remit of sport organisations and Member States.
The Commission supports the fight against doping and the important role of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), national anti-doping organisations (NADOs), accredited laboratories, the Council of Europe and UNESCO.
The Commission welcomes the fact that NADOs are increasingly organised as independent bodies.
It also encourages Member States to adopt and share national anti-doping action plans aimed at ensuring coordination among all relevant actors.
Many stakeholders call for a more active EU approach in the fight against doping, for example by joining, to the extent that the competences in this area entitle the Union to do so, the Anti-Doping Convention of the Council of Europe.
There is a need to assess the implications of the competence conferred upon the Union in Article 165 TFEU in relation to the EU's representation in WADA's governing structures.
The Commission underscores the need for anti-doping rules and practices to comply with EU law in respecting fundamental rights and principles such as respect for private and family life, the protection of personal data, the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.
Any limitation on the exercise of these rights and freedoms must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and the principle of proportionality.
Yeah, sorry.
I can't help you.
Steve, you got a pen?
Yeah, but remember, whoever she is, she got feelings.
Yes. How sensitive of you.
You're the regular guy around here?
Yeah?
So, who would have been working about two days ago?
Funny, I can't remember.
Well, thanks for your help.
And the water.
Anything?
A number.
Women and children only!
We are dressed in our best... and are prepared to go down as gentlemen.
But we would like a brandy.
Capitán, where should I go?
JACK:
No, you'll swamp us!
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
You want to walk a little faster through that valley, there?
Jack!
They had to row away for the suction... but now they'll be coming back.
Ahead easy.
LOWE: Can anyone hear me?
Jack?
'Now!' said Gimli.
'Stop him, Legolas!'
'Did I not say that I wished to speak to you?' said the old man.
'Put away that bow, Master Elf!'
The bow and arrow fell from Legolas' hands, and his arms hung loose at his sides.
'And you, Master Dwarf, pray take your hand from your axe-haft, till I am up!
You will not need such arguments.'
Gimli started and then stood still as stone, staring, while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat.
All weariness seemed to have left him.
How old were you?
Let's just say that I was old enough to know better and young enough not to care.
Ew.
I loved her.
And then she outgrew me...
And then she left.
But she came back.
That's so "Lolita."
You know, I'm not going anywhere without her.
There she is.
Thank you.
Nancy!
Did you do what I asked you to do?
Where's the baby?
47 The appellants confine themselves, by assertions, to challenging those findings of fact.
They do not produce any evidence such as to establish that the Court of First Instance distorted the clear sense of the evidence produced to it.
In any event it cannot be maintained that the Court of First Instance should have concluded from the absence of any complaint from a competitor that the Commission’s objectives were other than those stated.
48 It follows that the ground of appeal alleging misuse of powers must be rejected.
49 As regards the ground of appeal based on a failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on this point, it must be held that Ramondín did not raise that plea in its appeal.
That plea is inadmissible under Articles 42(2) and 118 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.
And he hasn't finished talking.
It's not true.
What matters is confessing.
Why would Zadovsky... ...confess things that could cost him his head? To... ...save his life.
He knows there's only one option: confessing.
But I have nothing to confess.
And don’t talk to him like that.
He is not a comrade but a traitor.
Go.
The Party abandons me; the friends, the comrades.
Nobody doubts my culpability I reacted the same way... …during the Rajk trails.
What communist wouldn’t be appalled?
How to even conceive that a Party which one hols infallible, ...can force innocents to confess?
We shall do everything we to reveal your treason to the Party and the people.
Zadovsky knew of the contacts with the American spy.
Help!
I don't believe it.
Are you Mr. Sparrow?
This way.
That's some ride, huh?
Mr. Sparrow, your influence might persuade your daughter and her husband to give themselves up.
Otherwise, I fear not only for the safety of our man but, frankly, for their lives as well.
You understand why I have to say that?
Yes, sir.
Whenever you're ready, you just press this black button down here.
talk in a normal tone of voice.
Press this button and talk in a normal tone of voice.
Just say whatever you think's right.
This is your daddy.
It's a good thing your poor mother is not alive to see what has become of you.
We can worry about correcting any of her mistakes after that.
And you're not worried about her handing power over to Prince Wu?
When Kuvira started cleaning up the earth kingdom, she knew her position wasn't permanent.
She gave me her word that she'd step down.
Still, I'd feel a lot better if Korra were here.
You've gotta help me get back into Avatar fighting shape.
I'm getting my butt kicked by losers all over the earth kingdom.
The world needs me.
Get over yourself.
The world doesn't need you one bit.
But while I've been the Avatar, I've stopped some really bad people from doing some really bad things.
Listen, when I was chief of police of Republic City, I worked my butt off busting criminals.
But did that make crime disappear?
Nope. If there's one thing I learned on the beat, it's that the names change, but the street stays the same.
So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless.
In order to reduce the deficit to below 3% of GDP as soon as possible, Cyprus shall stand ready to take additional consolidation measures.
Specifically, in the event of underperformance of revenues or higher social spending needs due to adverse macroeconomic effects, the government shall stand ready to take additional measures to preserve the programme's objectives, including by reducing discretionary spending, while minimising the impact on disadvantaged people.
Over the programme period, cash revenues above the programme projections, including any windfall gains, shall be saved or used to reduce debt.
If instead over-performance materialises, to the extent that it is deemed permanent, this can reduce the need for additional measures in the outer years.
Don't forget that.
Did you sleep well?
Where's Pazu?
I want to see Pazu!
Don't you like the latest fashions?
Don't worry about him.
His head is harder than mine.
Come, there's something I want you to see.
Go in.
What is it...?
It has terrible destructive power.
It's a robot soldier.

To disqualify the meat in question, which is fit for human consumption, from eligibility for an export refund likewise, in the view of the referring court, runs counter to the case-law of this Court, according to which the concept of fair marketable quality is dependent on it being possible to market the goods in question.
Nor, in the view of that court, does such a disqualification serve the interest of the Community, since the meat in question is marketable on one part of the Community market.

Tally lurched backward suddenly, snatching his manacled hands from Fraser's grip.
The policeman staggered, almost knocking Brian from his feet.
Tally turned and screeched through his cupped hands.
"Stop that fun, my hearties!"
His howl echoed down the brick-work canyon.
"Ye're hurtin' private property!"
Tom pounced on the man like lightning, with a wild spinning swing of his fist.
It's ringing.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Put the phone down.
Oh, fuck me.
What have you done to him?
He fainted.
Yeah, but you made him faint!
Yes. But it's not like I set my phaser to "Faint. "
You've got a phaser?
No, I don't...
Can we get this guy back onto your wagon?
Are you an alien?
To you, I am, yes.
Why does everyone always assume that?
On overtime, maybe.
You got enough overtime.
You buy the beer, Brody.
Well, look, you're in charge.
See you guys later.
I got more important things to do.
No overtime.
Ok.

No overtime!

These shoes cost me two hundred euros.
Who is that girl lying down?
Lavinia, Arnaldo's girlfriend.
A bitch.
Don't even try throwing me in the water or I'll kick your ass.
Honey.
Be careful, they'il throw you in the water.
She can't swim!
Help her!

Were you scared?
Me?
No.

You were right, Conrad.

Grayson Global's on track for the best quarter in history.
You "needs" it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other.

No, no, no.

A teenager in pegged jeans raced a middle-aged housewife for McVries's empty tube, which had stopped being something useful and had begun its new career as a souvenir.
The housewife was closer but the kid was faster and he beat her by half a length.

He scampered back to his friends, still waving it.
The housewife eyed him sourly.

As with other antiplatelet agents, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other pathological conditions and in patients receiving treatment with ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including Cox-2 inhibitors, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
Patients should be followed carefully for any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding,especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiac procedures or surgery.
The concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may increase the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.5).
If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and antiplatelet effect is temporarily not desirable, clopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days prior to surgery.
Patients should inform physicians and dentists that they are taking clopidogrel before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken.
Clopidogrel prolongs bleeding time and should be used with caution in patients who have lesions with a propensity to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular).
4 Patients should be told that it might take longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take clopidogrel (alone or in combination with ASA), and that they should report any unusual bleeding (site or duration) to their physician.
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely following the use of clopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure.
It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction or fever.
TTP is a potentially fatal condition requiring prompt treatment including plasmapheresis.
Acquired haemophilia Acquired haemophilia has been reported following use of clopidogrel.
In cases of confirmed isolated activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) prolongation with or without bleeding, acquired haemophilia should be considered.
Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acquired haemophilia should be managed and treated by specialists, and clopidogrel should be discontinued.
Recent ischaemic stroke In view of the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days after acute ischaemic stroke.

This told Maglore something and at the same time explained Zindevar's impatience and furtiveness, the way she shielded her mind against intrusion.
Quite obvi ously, she was one of Devetaki's informants in respect of Wratha's illegal activities.
But since Zindevar was known to operate a spy network second to none among Turgosheim's spires and manses, this hardly came as any great surprise.
To this end, the Commission intends to present a work programme to the Noise Committee referred to by Article 13 of the Directive including some of the elements identified below.
Where necessary, the Commission will also consider taking legal action to complement the proactive implementation activities listed below.
Finalising the harmonised framework for mapping methods Despite the improvements of comparability of strategic noise mapping, the situation is far from ideal.
The ongoing assessments have shown that it remains difficult to present comparable figures on the number of people being exposed to excessive noise levels.
Difficulties relate, inter alia , to differing ways in data collection, quality and availability and assessment methods used.
This leads to a variability of results across EU Member States.
The harmonisation framework of the method(s), which sufficiently reflects sectoral specificities, will ultimately lead to the required level of comparability.
In 2008, Commission efforts have started on developing harmonized methods for assessing noise exposure (according to article 6.2).
A project entitled "CNOSSOS-EU" (Common Noise Assessment Methods in Europe) led by the Joint Research Centre will provide the technical basis for preparing a Commission Implementing Decision.
Provided the technical work can be completed in 2011, the Commission is considering a possible revision of Annex II of the END in early 2012 (following Committee opinion in 2011).
The harmonised methodological framework could focus on the strategic mapping and would have to carefully balance the needs for harmonisation by proportionality and sectoral specificities, e.g. as regards data requirements.
As part of this decision, the Commission intends to propose a joint Commission/EEA/Member States work programme for the implementation of CNOSSOS-EU during 2012-2015 with the view to making it operational for the third reporting cycle in 2017.
Developing EU implementation guidance Many aspects of the Directive were not prescribed in detail or leave certain room for different interpretation and implementation.
Many Member States suggested that these issues could be addressed through dedicated action assisting in the implementation and compliance at EU level, such as the development of guidance documents, the information exchange of best practices or the organisation for specific workshops and training courses.
The following issues for such action were identified: mapping methods and best mapping practices, predictive values for noise maps, dose-response relationships, calculating multiple exposure, producing action plans and trigger or target values.

Francois and Katherine Coberg are trying to heal their marriage - and your detectives charge in with perverse insinuations about infidelities and spying.
It's irresponsible.
The papers'll eat up these unproven allegations.
I remind you there are young children involved.
They're four and two - a little young to read newspapers.
This is your elite squad?

Katherine and Francois Coberg are heading for a very expensive divorce over custody of those kids.
The Cobergs could use some leverage.

'As we've discovered, the Monolith is essentially a pure mechanism, doing just what it's been programmed to do.

Poole listened without interrupting; there was nothing he could contribute to the discussion, and indeed much of it was completely over his head.
Then, if it was a false alarm, no one would be any the worse.
And if it was not - well, humanity would still have peace of mind, before whatever inescapable doom awaited it.
He was still mulling over these gloomy thoughts when he was suddenly alerted by a familiar phrase.
A quiet little member of the Committee, with a name so long and difficult that Poole had never been able to remember, still less pronounce it, had abruptly dropped just two words into the discussion.

Article 28 of the Charter enshrines the right to collective bargaining.
That right must be exercised ‘in accordance with Union law’.
If a provision within a collective agreement is precluded by EU law, the national court must disapply that specific provision to the extent necessary to redress what is unlawful.
Thus, if the Court were to hold that EU law precluded the application of the pro rata temporis to the dependent child allowance, the specific provision providing for the allowance to be pro-rated for part-time workers (here, Article 22(4) of the banking sector collective agreement) would have to be disapplied.
As a result, the dependent child allowance would be payable in full under Article 22(1) of that agreement.

And why would he?
That's the plan, is it?
I'm not going to be doing a second Christmas with you.
So if I ever see you with him again...
Adam!
Detective.
Back again.
Two Years Ago
I know what you're doing here.
I know all about Rossum's sick experiments.
So I gather.
You're quite the supersleuth.
People will find out.
People... will find out?
Caroline, don't be silly.
We both know you could vanish off the face of the earth, and not a soul would notice you were gone.
Did you know that Rossum is the world leader in producing MRI machines?
Congratulations.
Who cares?
We're also on the cutting edge of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's research.
Developing the newest atomic force microscopes.
We have clinical laboratories in every major city in the world.
Finally, as regards the precautionary principle, I would merely point out that the right to be heard, the right to a fair hearing and the obligation to respect the adversarial principle are determined by the nature of the proceedings and do not vary according to any greater or lesser need for precaution.
‘Specific’ problem 97.
The appellants argue in essence that the Court of First Instance failed to examine correctly the evidence which they had put forward to rebut the Commission’s conclusion that no problem specific to Upper Austria had been shown to exist.
I halfway smiled, too anxious to really feel amused.
"There's plenty to be worried about," I told Jacob.
"Like a bunch of really stupid wolves getting themselves hurt."
Jacob laughed his coughing bark.
Edward sighed.
"Jasper wants help.
You'll be okay without a translator?"
"I'll manage."
Edward looked at me wistfully for one minute, his expression hard to understand, then turned his back and strode over to where Jasper waited.
The ground was cold and uncomfortable.
Jacob took a step forward, then looked back at me, and a low whine rose in his throat.
He took another half-step.
"Go on without me," I told him.
"I don't want to watch."

Ive had enough!
I won't budge.
Call for reinforcements if you want.
Calm down.
It'll just take a second.
You're nuts!
Michelle?
Show him your ID, hurry up.
My metro pass That won't do.
Give him your ID.
Its on big deal.
Was that so hard?
Where you going?
My sweater suits you.
You can have it back.

'That, too.' Kelly laughed on his way back inside.
Ten minutes later he'd cleaned off and changed into a T-shirt and cutoffs.
He took a place on the flying bridge and watched Rosen prepare his boat for getting under way.
The surgeon actually impressed Kelly, particularly with his line handling.
'Next time let your blowers work for a while before you light off the engines,' Kelly said after Rosen started up.
'But it's a diesel.'
'Number one, "it" is a "she," okay?
Number two, it's a good habit to get into.
The next boat you drive might be gas.
You mean except for you.
Torsten... take a break.
Well,you better,Russell.
I tried.
The D.O.D. won't budge on the dates.
Dozens of teams are flying in from all over the world.
Then you better help me find Lieutenant Seabrook's killer. Where's your chief mechanic?
No,not possible.
That's definitely yellow light.
Cytology tests take 72 hours,but...
Dr. House gets his results back in ten minutes.
Tony!
What are you doing here?
Oh,well,I was in the area, and I thought I would, uh,drop this off. You found it.
Yes,I did.
I am Dr. Stangel.
It's Barney.
So my wife and I are trying to get pregnant.
Uh-uh, no.
I... (groans) Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?
Essie nodded.
"Will you take my hand, Essie Tregowan?"
And he reached out a hand to her.
Freckled it was, and although Essie's eyesight was going she could see each orange hair on the back of his hand, glowing golden in the afternoon sunlight.
She bit her lip.
Then, hesitantly, she placed her blue-knotted hand in his.
She was still warm when they found her, although the life had fled her body and only half the peas were shelled.
My husband...
He kept guns hidden in the walls.
I can show you.
I've never broken into my own place of employment, but desperate times...
Garbagemen can be so careless.
I say put this Bay Harbor Butcher on the city payroll.
Give him a corner office, a company car and all the ammunition he needs.
At least somebody is doing something to clean up Miami, which is more than I can say for those folks down at city hall.
Hey, Debra.
Maybe we can... do it again.
How would you feel about a real date?
How about Saturday?
Deal.
Then from the races of men, each God chose that people which pleased him.
And when there were yet peoples who had no God, the younger Gods drove them forth and said: "Go unto UL, and he shall be your God."
And UL did not speak.
For long and bitter generations, the Godless Ones wandered and cried out unheard in the wastelands and wilderness of the West.
Then there appeared among their numbers a just and righteous man named Gorim.
He gathered the multitudes before him and spoke to them:
Our children and our old men die.
Better it is that only one shall die.
Therefore, stay here and rest upon this plain.
I will search for the God named UL so that we may worship him and have a place in this world."
For twenty years, Gorim sought UL, but in vain.
Yet the years passed, his hair turned gray, and he wearied of his search.
Oh, this girl right out of NYU. She brought in chili and gave everybody food poisoning. I mean, people...
People were puking for days.
Anyway, Adam's got some ideas for fundraising.
Really?
Yeah, well,
I heard you were struggling a bit.
Momentarily.
Yeah, but it's the impression.
Yeah, and you know how impressions become facts with big donors.
Adam did some good work for me on my first run, and I just thought he could do the same here.
I mean, that is if it works for you two.
I'm just here to help, not get in your way.
It's Republican money.
You don't know that.
I know that.
We won!
You owe me 2000 piastres.
It's me.
Okay.
A real monster.
Goddamn.
Damn, pardon.
It was you they wanted.
You know, huh?
What have you done?
Paolo said Blomkvist contacted him to reach you.
What have the two together?
I must go.
There is something I must do.
There was a lady in here.
A short blonde one who disappeared.
Take it out of my salary, fifty bucks a week.
Hey, what gives?
Have we had a better offer?
Irving I don't know just how to tell you this, but Wait till I sit down.
Well, in regard to the story that goes with these There is no story.
W-why not?
I mean not as far as I'm concerned.
You wanna have a look at 'em?
How about a blow-up from a negative that size, huh?
It was on that basis that, upon instructions from the Commission, the European Standards Committee drew up European harmonised standard EN 71-3 “Safety of toys”
(“EN 71-3”), which infers from the limit values of bioavailability “migration limit values” for toy materials and described a procedure enabling them to be determined.
The migration limit values stated the maximum permissible quantity of a chemical substance which may migrate, that is to say, pass from a product to the exterior, for example enter the skin or the gastric juices.
He has learned to approximate any curve as an infinite series.”
Daniel took the stick from Leibniz, then swept out a curve in the dirt.
“Far from detracting from his knowledge, this has extended his grasp, by giving him a way to calculate the tangent to a curve at any point.”
He carved a straight line above the curve, grazing it at one point.
A black coach rattled up the street, its four horses driven onwards by the coachman’s whip, but veering nervously around piles of debris.
Daniel and Leibniz backed into a doorway to let it pass; its wheels exploded a puddle and turned Leibniz’s glyphs and Daniel’s curves into a system of strange canals, and eventually washed them away.
“Would that some of our work last longer than that,” Daniel said ruefully.
Leibniz laughed—for a moment—then walked silently for a hundred yards or so.
“I thought Newton only did Alchemy,” Leibniz said.
“From time to time, Oldenburg or Comstock or I cajole him into writing out some of his mathematical work.”
“Perhaps I need more cajoling,” Leibniz said.
“Huygens can cajole you, when you get back.”
Leibniz shrugged violently, as if Huygens were sitting astride his neck, and needed to be got rid of.
“He has tutored me well, to this point.
But if all he can do is give me problems that have already been solved by some Englishman, it must mean that he knows no more mathematics than I do.”
I guess about 7 1/2, 8.
Coupled with signs of lividity... ...all indications are she wasn't moved from place of death.

You have to have some of Donovan's cake.
You can take the leftovers home.
I'm not going anywhere.
Give me 10 minutes,I'll be ready for the second round.
We ordered the fight on pay-per-view tonight.
You do like boxing,right?
Marry me.
Should Ricky be involved in the meetings?
I'd wait.
First impressions are very important.
And I'd save Ricky for later in the process.
Okay.
Well,tell me about these couples.
Well,I'm not saying they're right, I'm just saying they're looking.
There' s the Lavenders.
VERY STRANGE. ALL ONE NEEDS DO IS TURN TO THE LAST PAGE AND THE ANSWER IS THERE.
There was an empty feeling, everywhere.
He just wanted to sleep.
'Is that clock right?'
'I'm afraid it is, Sybil.'
'I'll just go outside and wait for him, then.
I'll have the book ready,' said Lady Sybil.
'He won't let anything stop him, you know.'
'I'm sure he won't,' said Bunty.
'Although things can be very treacherous in the lower valley at this time of-' her husband began, and was fried into silence by his wife's stare.
It was six minutes to six.
It was a very little, watery sound, and came from somewhere in Vimes's trousers.
After a few moments, enough time to recollect that he had both hands and trousers, he reached down and with a struggle freed the Gooseberry from his pocket.

He was a good man.
Then his wife got sick.
She just couldn't take it anymore.
And he was never the same after that.
When Black Summer came and everyone else in the world was starving he swore he would do whatever it took to keep us alive. And he did.
I'm going back for Addy.
Hang on, Mack.
Garnett, do not try to stop me.
Nobody's gonna tryo stop you.
We're all going back.
We just need a plan.
You don't understand!
These people are worse than Zs!
They'll kill all of you!
Tell your mother I still don't forgive her for cheating on me.
And she owes me 20 push-ups.
Good-bye, sir.
General Richter, sir.
Would you accept a thank-you for fighting them there so we don't have to fight them here by joining my family for Thanksgiving?
Rallo, I don't think that's...
Shut your meat hole!
Why, I'd be honored to spend Thanksgiving with a young patriot like yourself.
I bought this wine from some fart sniffer at the airport.
Take that, Red Baron.
All right, I hear you.
This autopilot's pretty sweet.
Auto land.
Auto land.
Is Beetle Bailey as lazy as he seems?
I visited Vatican City several times when I was in Rome.
The art collection there, as you may imagine, is impressive, and my wife is interested in such things.
I took her there perhaps half a dozen times.
The area crawls with priests and nuns.
I confess I never looked about for security provisions, but nothing was readily apparent, aside from what you'd expect—measures against thefts and vandalism, that sort of thing.
There are the usual museum guards, whose main function seems to be to tell people where the lavatories are.
I can't.
I can't change a thing.
Whoa. Kid, what the hell?
No.
What's happening?
Henry.
Fix it. Write everything the way it was.
Without ink, he's not writing anything.
My blood.
Yes, when mixed with darkness, But you're not the savior here.
Because of him.
But that doesn't mean we didn't find one.
Hold on, mom.
"thanks to the hero regina's sacrifice, Isaac's villainous work was undone."
Henry?
Nancy Callahan, age 1 1 .
And she'il be raped and slashed to ribbons.
And that backup that we're waitin' on will just so happen to show up just late enough for Roark to get back to his US Senator daddy.
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.
Settle down and think straight.
You're pushin' 60 and you got a bum ticker.
Very good, sir.
It's a cat, it can't take the piss.
Not in my kitchen!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, just get rid of it, babe.
Smell of that.
From the cat.
The cat thinks we don't eat enough in this house.
Eh?
You reckon?
Yeah.
Nice food and all that.
It had its moments.
I woke up this morning with a 'Dear John' taped to my cock.
Get your shit together, the client's expecting us.
He invited Zeus to a banquet and then tried to serve him the flesh of a human being.
Angered, Zeus blew the place apart with lightning bolts and then punished Lycaon and his sons by turning them into wolves.
The part that's lesser known is how Lycaon sought out the druids to help turn him back to human.
Why druids?
The belief was that the ancient druids knew how to shape-shift.
They couldn't make Lycaon and his sons human again, but they did teach them how to shift back and forth.
And so the druids became important advisors to the packs.
They keep us connected to humanity.
But they're a secret even in the pack.
Sometimes only the Alpha knows who the emissary is.
For the Alpha pack.
Our guidance counselor?
I shared some really intimate details with her.
And did she give you good advice?
But today, hell, we can't even get his pump primed.
Uh, would you all excuse me please?
I need to talk with my nurse.
Excuse me.
Tell me they are not talking about what I think they're talking about.
What do you think they're talking about?
Masturbating an impotent bull.
So what do you think, Doc?
Well, you know what, we just got a page uh, telling us that a sheep has fallen into a lake and is shrinking at an amazing rate.
Just getting smaller and smaller.
Go look over there.
Yes, sir.
You better find somebody or it's your ass.
How small can a sheep get, I guess.
So, um, how do you get things started?
Sil Lite?
You're a counsellor, aren't you?
I'm still in training.
What will you learn in the next few months that you haven't learned in the last 300 years?
How to keep from breaking into tears, how to stop standing on my head.
Things like that.
Why are you standing on your head?
Emony used to do it.
The gymnast?
She found it relaxing.
Do you?
Actually, it's giving me a headache.
Why can't Julian work with Garak?
Julian's no counsellor, not even an assistant counsellor.
I bet he doesn't stand on his head.
That's a good point.
I don't know what the hell you talking about, bro.
I need the names of those triggermen now!
Marlon, wait!
Yo, Marlon, stop!
Marlon, he's a cop!
Marlon, he's a cop!
Hey!
Get your black ass up.
Damn, J-Dub, so you're the cub?
Hey, Lopez, what the hell you doing here, man?
Why you sneaking up to see my informant without telling me?
Look, I know J-Dub's your C.I., but he's also a Lord, and we're running out of time.
We need the names of those shooters, and I was prepared to do things you wouldn't.
Like what?
I bust ass, too.

If anyone needed me, I'd send them a vision, sort them out.
I was like... human television.
You're the patron saint of television?
Keeps me busy.
You know?
You can do what you like up there, son.
It's down here, you have to make the effort.
Do you ever come across a Saint Maureen?
She hasn't been there long.
Don't ring a bell.
Then again, it is infinite up there.
Absolutely bloody infinite.

It must have been difficult for you.
It was, a bit. But it would have been all right. I know it would.
And now this.
You have my deepest sympathies, Mrs. Appleby.
You will be at the house if we want you?
Want me?
I'm afraid so. It's the law.
Your husband's solicitor has been informed.
He will be coming from London this morning.
Your husband was rich, wasn't he?
I suppose so.
And now everything comes to you.
I believe so. It would have gone to Penny.
Quite so.
You'll ask the solicitor to contact me?
However, within the framework permitted by the present case-law, the fact that, in the course of applying to annul the contested decision, 3F called into question the merits of the contested decision means that the Plaumann test for standing is to be applied.
Up until now we had only two things going for us. No one knew where we were or where we were goin'.
I was wondering-- -Listen, little boy.
Of course I want you to go. That's what's worrying you.
I always wanted to travel. I just never got the opportunity.
Well, we don't need the East Coast anymore.
Look who it is, it's that guy.
Just the... ...just the look on his face when--
What?
Hey, Thelma, look, I'm warnin' you.
Just drop it.
I'm not gonna talk about that.
You understand?
You understand?
Yeah. Okay, Louise.
What shall we do?
"Insanely," Sasha said.
Orson chuffed.
That night we wrapped the dead monkeys in sheets.
We wrapped Scorso's body in a sheet, too.
He was here to bring you back.
Rabbit must want you before me.
Olek hasn't checked in yet.
That buys us some time.
Okay. Time for what?
It's suicide.
Oh, my God, my babies, Gordon...
You have.
We were safe until you got here.
How many other mothers carry guns in their purse?
Or fake license plates in their car?
You knew this day was coming.
You've known it since the day you landed here. And every one of those days you lied to your family, not me.
Carrie Hopewell was never built to last.
What more could you want.
There's sheets on the furniture and the cemetery in the back yard, and... ... cobwebs on the lampshades.
All right, all right.
Lance, why don't we get the generator started, and... ... where's the basement?
Well, there should be a door somewhere... over... ... there.
Any of the rooms.
We won't have a line out until tomorrow.
Great.
Wanna go home, Wanda?
Don't forget, Whitaker did see something... ... something that drove him out of his mind.
Wanda, can you help me with this?
I thought I heard something, some kind of groaning.
Come on, it's an old place.
No, it was something else.
It was some kind of... ... flapping or something.
Creating a business-friendly legal and fiscal environment For our businesses to benefit from all of the opportunities offered by the single market, including freedom of establishment, the rules on which that market is based need to be straightforward and geared towards dealing with the problems they encounter in their day-to-day operations.
The measures proposed in this sector envisage, inter alia, a reduction of the administrative and regulatory burden, with positive consequences for growth and job creation[17].
Very practical initiatives will therefore be taken to ensure the linking of company registers and the mutual recognition of e-identification and e-authentication in the European Union.
Taxation issues are also crucial.
Initiatives relating to the corporate tax base or to VAT will be designed to limit the administrative burden on businesses and to promote cross-border activity.
Defence and security, high-technology sectors characterised by innovation and know-how, can trigger development and growth throughout the economy and are therefore also deserving of attention.
Proposal No 19 : The Commission will take steps to improve the coordination of national tax policies, notably by proposing a Directive introducing a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) in 2011.
The current existence of 27 highly disparate corporate tax systems in the single market means that companies are faced with significant tax obstacles which discourage, if not impede, their cross-border activities.
Such fragmentation gives rise to significant market distortions and compliance costs.
It particularly affects SMEs, which often lack the resources to resolve these inefficiencies and may even be discouraged from expanding across borders at all.
The introduction of a common consolidated corporate tax base is intended to tackle fiscal impediments to growth.
Groups of businesses would have to apply a single set of tax rules and deal with only one tax administration across the EU (one-stop-shop).
Accordingly, revenues would be consolidated at the group level and profits would be set off against losses without any border barriers.
Double taxation or double non-taxation as a result of the current disparities or mismatches among national tax rules would also be eliminated intra-group.
Uncoordinated national action would continue to replicate the current situation in that companies would still need to apply as many tax systems as Member States in which they operate.
107 It should be recalled in that regard that, under Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1515/2001, where the Dispute Settlement Body adopts a report with regard to a non-disputed measure, the Council may, as it deems appropriate, repeal or adopt the disputed measure, or adopt any other special measure which its deems appropriate in order to take account of the legal interpretations made in the report.
Accordingly, recital 5 of that regulation states that the EU institutions may consider it appropriate to repeal, amend or adopt any other special measures with respect to measures taken under the basic regulation, including measures which have not been the subject of dispute settlement under the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes, in order to take account of the legal interpretations made in a report adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body.
108 Second, as correctly pointed out by the applicant, EU legislation must be interpreted, so far as possible, in the light of international law, in particular where such legislation is specifically intended to implement an international agreement concluded by the Community, as is the case with the basic regulation, which was adopted to meet international obligations arising under the anti-dumping agreement (see recital 3 of the basic regulation).
13 – Emphasis added.
14 – The Court held in Case C‑112/11 ebookers.com Deutschland [2012] ECR, that optional price supplements ‘relate to services which, supplementing the air service itself, are neither compulsory nor necessary for the carriage of passengers or cargo, with the result that the customer chooses either to accept or refuse them’ (paragraph 14).
15 – Paragraph 19 of those observations.
The precautionary principle mainly confers on the Community legislature broader, but not unlimited, discretion.
When the legislature intends to use this extended discretion it is subject to a heavy burden of proof to make sure that the alleged risk is not merely hypothetical.

Sorry, but was this sexual activity pretty vigorous?
It was really good.
That's all I need.

Almost never.
So, was it just...

So many questions.
But if you could answer any of them, then you wouldn't be fascinating.

The applicant alleged that new product types have appeared on the market such as plywood consisting solely of sheets of wood, each ply not exceeding 6 mm thickness, with at least one outer ply of bintangor, red canarium, kedondong or certain other species, not coated by a permanent film of other material.
These products should be included in the scope of the measures on the grounds that they share the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and end uses as the product covered by the existing measures.
Both the product concerned and the new product types should therefore be considered as a single product.
Rather than go on with the venture under these conditions, I knew that I was doing the safest, wisest thing by getting the hell out.
I had gained enough knowledge of the layout and the conditions for my chances to be better next time around.
All right...
The sky brightened above me, the colors and shadings lost something of their arbitrary, meandering habit.
The flames began to subside about me.
Good.
Clouds started to find their ways across the sky.
Excellent.
Soon a localized glow began behind a cloudbank.
Superb.
When it went away, a sun would hang once again in the heavens.
I looked back and was surprised to see that I was still being pursued.
However, it could easily be that I had not dealt properly with their analogues for this slice of Shadow.

Pentola... he sent Kyle's journal to Dr. Dana.
She loves it. She wants me to be on the show.
He never talked with me like that.
He didn't want people to know because he was afraid of being treated differently. But it doesn't make sense. He was already treated like a freak.
Oh, Jesus christ, Andrew.

A dead woman put the tape in your room?
No, of course not.
I mean, she needed help.
Someone to keep it, release it.
Someone dedicated to the cause.
Someone she could trust.
What a dump.
The guy's a freak.
A zealot who's OD'd on too many good causes.
You know, the original plan was probably for Dusty to release the tape after Gale's conviction.
You know, after a year or so.
It'd force him to dry out, give him back his dignity.
So Dusty Wright is sitting on this tape, waiting.
And he's the only one who knows about it.
So Dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a lot more politically useful than a last-minute save.
Therefore, one single Member State cannot manage its internal taxation system, especially as regards direct taxation, without information coming from other Member States.
In order to overcome the negative effects of this phenomenon, it is indispensable to develop a new administrative cooperation between the Member States' tax administrations.
There is a need for instruments likely to create confidence between Member States, by setting up the same rules, obligations and rights for all Member States.
In the first Drenai line Diagoras sheathed his sword, wiping his sweating palm on his red cloak.
"There are enough of them,' he said.
Beside him Certak nodded.
'Masterly understatement.
They look like they could run right over us.'
'We'll have to surrender, won't we?' whispered Orases from behind them, blinking sweat from his eyes.
'Somehow I don't think that's likely,' said Certak.
'Though I admit it's a welcome thought.'
A rider on a black stallion forded the stream and galloped towards the Drenai line.
Delnar walked through the ranks, Druss beside him, and waited.
Reining in before the two men, he leaned forward on the pommel of his saddle.
'Druss?' he said.
'Is that you?'
Druss studied the gaunt features, the silver-streaked dark hair hanging in two braids.
'Welcome to Skeln, Bodasen,' answered the axeman.
If you received Inflectra during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection.
It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your Inflectra use before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section on vaccination).
Driving and using machines Inflectra is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines.
If you feel dizzy after having Inflectra, do not drive or use any tools or machines.
Inflectra contains Sodium This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’.

Consequently, in order to exclude cases which are based on humanitarian grounds from the subsidiary protection regime, as [Directive 2004/83] was never intended to cover those cases, the Presidency proposes to limit the scope of paragraph (b) by stating that a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment must exist in the country of origin’. ( 26 ) 65.
Although, as the Court pointed out in Elgafaji, ( 27 ) Article 15(b) of Directive 2004/83 ‘corresponds, in essence, to Article 3 of the ECHR’ ( 28 ), the EU legislature nevertheless limited its scope to the treatment ‘of an applicant in the country of origin’, ( 29 ) which presupposes that the public authorities of that country are, directly or indirectly, responsible.
The international protection regime, in particular subsidiary protection status, does indeed establish, therefore, its own specific protection mechanism, ( 30 ) which is distinct from the obligations incumbent on the Contracting States under Article 3 of the ECHR.

That's what I meant.
I get confused.
I was recently hit on the head. Hmm.
Who are you?
"Stop it," I said.
I sounded like myself, even though I looked like Julia.
"Stop it."
"Dont you like it?
I think its amusing.
"I said, stop it."
"Jack, youre just no fun anymore."
I pulled at the Julia-image on my face, trying to tear it away like a mask.
But I felt only my own skin beneath my fingertips.
When I scratched at my cheek, the Julia-cheek showed scratches in the mirror.
I reached back and touched my own hair.
It clattered on the concrete floor.
"Get it off me," I said.
"Get it off."
I heard a whoosh in my ears, and the Julia-skin was gone, sweeping into the air, then descending onto Julia.
She's losing too much blood.
No, no, my head is burning!
It's the venom.
You have to make a choice.
No.
No.
She's still hemorrhaging.
Your belt.
Carlisle, what's my other option?
Tie it above my hands.
Carlisle!
Go.
We could try to suck the venom out.
Then find the will to stop.
But choose.

What was that?
What's our temperature down here?
Get ready to expand the probe arm to get samples.
What was that?
Oh, shit.
Recycle power.
All right, let's run some tests.
There was an abnormal shift in the velocity of the current.
Is it a remote issue?
Shit.
Can you play back the video?
Did something hit the probe?
It seemed like it was right under the probe.
What was the last piece of data it sent?
You should be.
It's a big day.
Did you get my present?
What present?
A basket.
You should've gotten it by now.
Did a basket come for me?
It was heavy.
I felt a twinge, so I dropped it for health reasons.
It's probably still intact.
My cracked staff has just informed me of its arrival.
I'm going to find it.
I put it together myself.
A $25 savings bond.
That's a long-term investment.

I can't wait.
How do you like it?
This is so good.
Want to try some?
No.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry about the RePet.
Dad?
Did Oliver die?
Is he a RePet?
Why do you say that?
You locked him outside.
I did?
No, it's not pretty.
It's tacky.
What's her name again?
I forget.
No.
I mean, you are married.
You know what it's like.
After they've... lost it?
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.
And I would expect you, of all people, would understand my feelings on misuse of power.
Yes, I know, Charles.
When are you going to stop lecturing me?
When you start listening.
Bobbie.
I'm happy and I'm healthy because I understand what's important in life.
Yes.

It has immunomodulating/immunosuppressive characteristics, acts as an antiproliferative agent, and displays anti-inflammatory properties.
Leflunomide exhibits the best protective effects on animal models of autoimmune diseases when administered in the early phase of the disease progression.
In vivo, it is rapidly and almost completely metabolised to A771726 which is active in vitro, and is presumed to be responsible for the therapeutic effect.
Mechanism of action
A771726, the active metabolite of leflunomide, inhibits the human enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and exhibits antiproliferative activity.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Rheumatoid arthritis
The efficacy of leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated in 4 controlled trials (1 in phase II and 3 in phase III).
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL - Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The proposal responds to the sharp downturn faced by the European economy in the wake of the financial crisis and to shortcomings in the Community's security of energy supply illustrated by the gas crisis.
It implements the European Economic Recovery Plan (COM (2008) 800) endorsed by the European Council of 11-12 December 2008.
Together with the proposals in the area of broadband and rural development, it specifically responds to the request of the European Council to provide a detailed and balanced list of actions.
- General context The financial crisis began to spread to the real economy in autumn 2008.
The gas crisis, involving lack of delivery to the Community of gas produced in Russia, emerged in December 2008.
The economic crisis and the gas crisis which has shown that energy interconnections in Europe are not sufficient, both pose structural problems for the European economy and the welfare of Europe's citizens.
A comprehensive Recovery Plan is needed and is being put in place; this proposal for a financial stimulus to key parts of the energy sector is an essential element of the Plan.
- Existing provisions in the area of the proposal The energy infrastructure part of the Trans-European Networks programme aims to catalyse the construction of cross-border gas and electricity interconnections; that is also the aim of one of the three sub-programmes of this proposal.
It's true.

I-I should have told you who I was when I first got here.
So I'm sorry.

Identification documents for Lien Mah.
Fake birth certificate.
Fake passport.
Death certificate.
Proof of embalming.
Everything necessary to convince the U.S. State Department that Lien Mah was a Chinese national who died while visiting the United States and to arrange for her body's return to her homeland.
Who would ship a fictitious Chinese corpse to China?
A rather clever smuggler, I imagine.
So, if Lien Mah is fake, then whose body are they shipping overseas?
"Marjorie Lin, 24, was laid to rest Monday afternoon.
Not 10 hours later, her body was stolen in a brazen midnight grave robbery."
You think the smuggler is using Marjorie Lin's body?
Compare the photo on Lien Mah's false passport to the photo of Marjorie Lin in the paper.
No.
Is that a guess?
You said the guy who hanged himself might have worked for Gino Fish.
Gino didn't do this.

We're gonna get someone to try to help bury her in the backyard.
We thought it'd be funny to hire a guy to come over and dig a hole in the backyard, thinking it's for a tree or something, and then spring it on them that,
"No, what actually, this is for my wife, and would you carry the body "out from the house and drop it in the hole and bury her?"
I had a terrible time at the funeral home trying to bury my wife.
I was wondering if I could pay you a little money to help me bury her in her favorite spot.
I can't do that, no.
I can give you an extra $60.
I don't think that's legal, and I don't want to be getting into trouble.
We tried this in Columbus, and people wanted nothing to do with it.
No, I can't do that.
Can you help me just carry her outside to bury her?

21 By letter of 24 March 2003 the Commission renewed its original request in relation to imports of material for specifically military purposes prior to 1 January 2003, since the period after that date was covered by Regulation No 150/2003.
22 In its reply of 7 May 2003 the Kingdom of Denmark maintained its position.
23 By letter of 17 October 2003 the Commission again gave formal notice to the Kingdom of Denmark that it should make the calculations required for the determination of the amount of own resources which had not been paid to the Community because imports of specifically military equipment had been exempted from customs duties in the financial years 1998 to 2002, that it should make those resources available to the Commission and that it should pay the default interest which was payable pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation No 1150/2000.

Understand the cell and you'd understand what life was.

"Oh, the war.
What is the news?"
The archivist shook his head:
I smiled at the archivist.
"And do you believe that some 'rough beast, its hour come round at last,/ Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born'?"
The archivist did not smile.
"Yes, sir, I do."

You're absolutely right.
There are some people who stop on a journey at a motorway services to play a fruit machine.
If you're Alec Guinness and you've been in a box in a Japanese prison for six months, yes, you need to stretch your legs, but after 30 miles in a car, you don't.
It's when people say they need to stop to eat. Why?
I can't imagine a journey long enough that means YOU will need refuelling.
Well, if you were driving from Cairo to Khartoum... Yes, but not in Britain.
If you're going from Leicester to Birmingham, you don't need food.
No, and I'm glad you brought this up because this is where I'm going, OK?
One place I could never understand why people stopped at was Little Chef, because what they did was they took ingredients and then ruined them.
I once stopped at a Little Chef very early in the morning and I said, "Could I have an omelette?"
The woman said, "No, I'm sorry sir, the powder hasn't arrived yet".
That's not a good sign, is it?!
I once dropped a sausage from my plate in Little Chef and it bounced.
They made it out of old squash balls!
The other day, we heard they'd shut getting on for half their outlets, and we weren't surprised, but the other day we stopped at one that was still open.

There's a nerve cluster just behind the carotid artery.
It stimulates the brain to release natural endorphins.

I think I can do this.
We talked about confronting fear.

I suppose I did.
I'm gonna beam over.
I can do it!

No sweat.
Because it is a big deal.
I mean, sex made your whole life start... and if you think about life as like a circle or something... then sex and death are the same-- Look, I'm not I'm not saying... they're the same, I've thought about having sex with you... and God, I've never seriously thought of killing you, but --

Dr. Harris: Clearly more interested in the destruction and manipulation.
Because of the research that's on the Getty Museum's website, it's actually pretty clear that he's really playing with perspective.
Dr. Zucker: In a very conscious way.
Dr. Harris: And distorting the perspective.
It seems, from recent research, that in fact, the male viewer that we see reflected is actually just out of our view, over to the left.
Dr. Zucker: In fact, we're viewing this over from the right and the combination of those two perspectives actually bring those two figures together (crosstalk) but only in the reflection in a way that is wonderfully staged and constructed.
Dr. Harris: In a way, he's saying that the mirror is not this thing that's represented the truth, a metaphor (crosstalk)
Right, that paintings are a mirror of the visual world.
Here, he's taking that mirror and saying, "No, mirrors are false, mirrors are just as constructed, "in a way, as everything else, based on our point of view."

No, we are not going to sell you.
But I've got a job.
Really?
Yes, at the grocer's store.
The owner is in a nursing home.
So therefore, her son needs help.
The store is actually the least of his problems, from what I've heard.
But I'm only helping out around the store, of course.
Full time.
But.
What about us?
You will have to go with me, Junior.
Maybe you can take the bus home with Phillip?

I fingerprinted them first, of course, for your records.
Mind if we take a look at the bodies?
Their bodies were sent to the funeral home for cremation, as per their living wills and religious requirements.
That must be some kind of record.

42 By failing to refer to Article 2 of the comitology decision, which provides non-binding criteria for the choice of procedure to be followed, the Court of First Instance incorrectly stated in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal that the regulatory procedure may be used only for measures of general scope.
– Arguments of the Commission 43 The Commission takes the view that reference to recital 39 of Regulation No 3319/94 is irrelevant for the purposes of the interpretation of the second subparagraph of Article 1(3) of that regulation, which provides for a specific duty in the presence of two objective conditions, namely, indirect invoicing and the import of a ZAP product.
44 As to Article 2 of the comitology decision, the Commission disputes CMF’s claim that the Court of First Instance stated that the regulatory procedure may be used only for measures of general scope.
Findings of the Court 45 Neither of the two parts of this ground of appeal nor, in consequence, the ground of appeal itself, is capable of standing alone.
47 However, as the Advocate General observes in point 41 of his Opinion, the arguments relating to the two parts of this ground of appeal are presented in closer detail in the context of the fourth and third grounds of appeal respectively, in which it is specifically the legal analysis of the Court of First Instance that is challenged.
48 The two parts are thus indissociable from the fourth and third grounds of appeal.
49 Consequently, there is no need to consider them separately.
Alleged distortion of the facts Arguments of the parties – Appellant’s arguments 50 CMF claims that, in paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, in which the facts of the case are presented, the Court of First Instance adopted the wholly false inferences drawn by the national competent authorities as to the existence of indirect invoicing.
51 According to CMF, that presentation is incomplete and incorrect, and involves a distortion of the facts.
Each was a burly hard-faced six-footer in his early twenties.
Each had his head shaven to protect him from the other’s grip.
And when they took off their rough shirts each had the same rippling steel of knotted muscles and bore on his back ancient ruts from the cat-o’-nine-tails.
The fighters were beautifully matched and everyone knew that much was at stake.
The admiral and the general had personally approved the selection of the fighters, and had exhorted them to win.
The honor of the whole Service was on their shoulders, the wealth of the savings of their mates.
The future would be sweet for the victor.
For the vanquished there would be no future.
Henry Hardy Hibbs climbed through the single rope and stood in the center of the ring where the yard-square mark had been chalked.
“Yor ’Hexcellency, Yor ’Ighness, M’Lords and Yor ’Onors,” he began.
“A fight to the finish, between, in this corner, Bosun Jem Grum o’ the Royal Navy—”
There was a huge cheer from the mob of sailors to the east and jeers and obscenities from the packed ranks of English and Indian soldiers to the west.
Longstaff, the archduke, the admiral and the general were seated in the place of honor on the north ringside, an honor guard of impassive marines surrounding them.
Behind the archduke were his two liveried bodyguards, armed and vigilant.
Struan, Brock, Cooper, Tillman, Robb, Gorth and all the tai-pans had seats on the south side, and behind them were the lesser traders and naval and army officers, all elbowing for a better view.
We are on the lookout.
What if some good guys came?
We're on the road.
I know.
If you're on the lookout all the time does that mean that you're scared all the time?
I suppose you have to be scared enough to be on the lookout in the first place.

Sopli was not so mad, or not so simply mad, as his wild hair and fragmented talk made him appear.
Indeed the maddest thing about him was perhaps his terror of the water.
To stand up in the boat made him giddy; he clung to the mast.

B.
I don't know what this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
Watch your language.
I'll take it.
It'il be enough.
Come out of there, Solo!
Right here, Jabba.
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.
Why haven't you paid me... and why did you fry poor Greedo?
Han, I can't make exceptions.
It's not good business.
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.
In that connection, it is sufficient for the common component not to be negligible.
57 However, it is clear that the General Court found, first, that the overall impression created by the mark applied for is dominated by the element ‘creaciones kennya’, on which the consumer concerned will to a very great extent focus his attention and, second, in particular at paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the element ‘ck’ occupies only an ancillary position in relation to that element, which, in essence, amounts to a conclusion that the element ‘ck’ in the mark applied for is negligible.
58 Thus, having ruled out, on the basis of a properly conducted analysis, any similarity between the marks at issue, the General Court correctly concluded, at paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, that, notwithstanding the reputation of the earlier marks and the fact that the goods covered by the marks at issue are identical, there is no likelihood of confusion between the marks.
59 The third part of the first ground of appeal must therefore be declared unfounded.
60 In those circumstance, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
The second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By its second ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court for failing to have regard to Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 by failing to examine the reputation of the earlier marks in the context of that provision.
62 The General Court erred by stating, at paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, that the appellant relies on a single plea in law, alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, whereas the application was also expressly based on infringement of Article 8(5) of that regulation.
63 By stating that, since the marks at issue are not similar, there was no need to consider the reputation of the earlier marks, the General Court erred in law.
In the appellant’s view, account should have been taken of the fact that Calvin Klein’s earlier mark cK is well known in determining whether it should be afforded greater protection.
The reputation of an earlier mark should be considered in the course of the assessment of the similarity between the marks at issue and not after similarity has been established.
64 In that connection, the appellant submits that if the well-known cK marks were protected only when the letters ‘cK’ were used by third parties with the same mode of graphic representation, that would be tantamount to conferring on the well-known mark CK a lower level of protection in practice than it would enjoy if it was not widely known.
The fact that the cK trade marks, along with other distinct graphic representations of those letters, are well known protects them against the use of the letters ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, since, in that sector, those letters are identified with Calvin Klein, so that the use of those letters by a third party would lead to confusion by association.
65 OHIM contends that, in the judgment under appeal, the General Court gave a correct ruling on the question of the reputation of the earlier mark.
Since the signs at issue cannot be regarded as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 is not applicable.
66 Zafra Marroquineros submits that the judgement under appeal refers to the reputation of the earlier marks.

Just two steps behind is our kitchen.
Put me down!
Roderick!
Do you believe in God?
Well, do you?
Of course.
Would you like to meet him?
Not yet, no.
Then you will answer our questions.
How did you get here?
I won't answer.
And not telling us.
You are a descendent of Erik the Terrible, are you not?
Are you not?
Erik the Great?
I need a push!
Well, I think that went pretty well.
Hi, honey, it's your mother.
Listen, that rash you described... ...really doesn't sound like jock itch.
Maybe you should get it checked out.
It was a spider bite.
Hey, it's AJ and Hack.
Ever.
I suggest you take this seriously and don't get any ideas.
And I think the cops will be real interested in your involvement anyway.
When you have the money, leave a message on my pager.
I'm sure they will break the gate doors and enter.
if they do, we will use these!
Tomorrow, we'il protect you, your highness.
I am a free man.
Kill me.
They've never valued what you are.

Koreans and the Hans look very much alike.
We're like brothers.
This has dragged on too long..
Kill them all!
Before sunset, we head back to prairie.
Wait!
Mr O lives with Ms S and her two children.
21 According to the order for reference, Mr O entered into a contract of employment on 1 January 2010 for a period of one year, under which he was to work eight hours a day and be paid EUR 7.50 an hour.
He has not, however, produced documents to show that he worked in accordance with the contract.
22 By decision of 21 January 2009, the Maahanmuuttovirasto refused Mr O’s application for a residence permit on the ground that he did not have secure means of subsistence.
It also considered that in the present case there was no reason to make an exception to the requirement of means of subsistence, as permitted by Paragraph 39(1) of the Law on foreigners where there is an exceptionally serious reason or where the best interests of the child demand it.
23 By judgment of 27 August 2009, the Helsingin hallinto-oikeus (Administrative Court, Helsinki) dismissed the action brought by Mr O for the decision of the Maahanmuuttovirasto to be annulled.
24 Ms S and Mr O therefore appealed against that judgment to the Korkein hallinto-oikeus (Supreme Administrative Court).

Guess what the fuck's up?
Allison's going into labor and you are not fucking here.
Now, where are you?
You're ata fucking bar mitzvah in San Francisco, you motherfucking piece of shit!
Tio Luca, came back to this shithole just to save me.
At least somebody in this family cares whether or not I die.
How did he get here?
That pendejo's been dead 10 years.
How did he get here?
He's a medium!
Wait, me?
But what I don't get is how you can risk my life just to prove your point!
Don't be so dramatic.
I wouldn't sacrifice you.
Wait, can we go back to how I'm a medium?
(DON BARTOLO) He's so smart, let him explain it to you.
I had to prove it to you.
(IN SPANISH)
(DOOR CLOSES) Well, you could have just fuckin' said so.
Before you say anything, you should know that my ex-wife thinks that all my girlfriends are thieves, so it's cool.
No, it's not.
I really wanted your family to like me.
Oh, that's so sweet.
You know what?
I think someone just stole my heart.
Too soon?
Coming.
He broke up with me.
Who?
Ryan.
He was supposed to break up with his wife.
Okay, I know you're going through a lot right now and I'm really glad you came, but we need to get this dress on you, sweetheart, okay?
Take off your clothes.
That's the second to the last thing he ever said to me.
To ensure coherence with the market access provisions for sugar in the Economic Partnership Agreements, the duty free access for sugar should apply from 1 October 2009 and the tariff quota for products of subheading 1701 11 10 as opened under the special arrangement for the least developed countries should be extended until 30 September 2009 with a pro rata increase of its volume.
In addition, for the period between 1 October 2009 and 30 September 2012 the importer of products of heading 1701 undertakes to purchase such products at a price not lower than a minimum price.

Which is why we are signatories to RACTO, or whatever the hell that is.
Rainforests of the Americas Conservation Treaty Organization, sir.
You're the fainter, aren't you?
I'm sorry. It's just that nothing funny ever happens in this town.
Don't worry. You'll bounce back.
Look, for a few billion dollars, we can save one of the most ecologically-important areas on Earth.
If you've got a few billion dollars lying around, go for it, because Congress won't.
Come on.
We're not seriously falling back on the mighty RACTO? ...as non-invasively as possible.
Which is more than the Chinese can say.
Look, I'm all for saving the planet, but the bottom line is, if we can't get our company in, we should at least keep the Chinese one out.
These are independent countries, Russell.
So find more cards.
Thank you, Laura.
"That is exactly the word I wanted," said the general with satisfaction—"a curiosity.
However, the most astonishing and, if I may so express myself, the most painful, thing in this matter, is that you cannot even understand, young man, that Lizabetha Prokofievna, only stayed with you because you are ill,—if you really are dying—moved by the pity awakened by your plaintive appeal, and that her name, character, and social position place her above all risk of contamination.
Lizabetha Prokofievna!" he continued, now crimson with rage, "if you are coming, we will say goodnight to the prince, and—"

He's not learning anything good from you.
Please wait here.
I'll go get him. This guy is gonna miss his maid in Rikers.

Let's see what they want.
I've heard enough about Lord Myron.

Speaking of names, you go by Marshall or Lee?
My friends call me Marshall, but my family calls me Lee.
Why? Well...
This about that dead girl at the hotel?
Red team won't know what hit them.
Are we gonna beat red team this year?
I can't stand him, Mimsy.

Shut up, Mimsy.
Oh, sorry boss.

What did you say you did for a living?
Elisabeth Deroulede.
Deroulede!
Shame on you!
My Dear Robert... Sorry it didn't work out.
Maybe we could meet again sometime.
Sleep well.
Elisabeth.
And add this:
Nobody has passed through these woods for years.
She is about your height, brown eyes.
Was she pretty?
Beautiful.
Who are you?
This girl, you must care about her a lot to come into the woods looking for her.
Very much.
Come with me.
Yes, it is.
Please come in.
Sit.
Do you know what this does?
No.
It lets you see what you truly want in this world.
I want you to have it.
The details for that system should be established.
Cross-compliance checks may be finalised before or after the payments and annual premia referred to in Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 are received.
In particular, where such checks cannot be finalised before those payments and annual premia are received, the amount due to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of any administrative penalty should be recovered in accordance with this Regulation or by offsetting.
Rules regarding the authorities in the Member States responsible for the control system concerning cross-compliance obligations should be laid down.
The minimum control rate for verifying the respect of the cross-compliance obligations should be established.
That control rate should be fixed, at least, at 1 % of the total number of the beneficiaries referred to in Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 falling within the area of competence of each control authority to be selected on the basis of an appropriate risk analysis.
For the purpose of calculating the control sample, in the specific case of a group of persons as referred to in Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, Member States should be afforded flexibility in determining whether to consider the group as whole, or each of its members, individually.
Member States should be given the option to fulfil the minimum control rate at the level of each competent control authority, at the level of the paying agency or at the level of an act or standard, or group of acts or standards.
Where the specific legislation applicable to the act or standards provides for minimum control rates, Member States should respect those rates.
However, Member States should be allowed to apply a single control rate for the cross-compliance on-the-spot checks.
If Member States choose this option, any instance of non-compliance detected in the course of on-the-spot checks under the sectorial legislation should be reported and followed-up under cross-compliance.
For the sake of simplification, as regards the cross-compliance obligations in relation to Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the application of a specific sampling level of monitoring plans should be considered to fulfil the requirement of the minimum rate set by this Regulation.
Member States should be conferred with the flexibility necessary to reach the minimum control rate by using the results of other on-the-spot checks or by replacing beneficiaries.
In order to avoid any weakening of the control system, in particular as to the sampling for the cross-compliance on-the spot-checks, follow-up checks carried out in reference to the de minimis rule, provided for in Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 should not be taken into account in the calculation establishing the cross-compliance minimum control sample.
The determination of significant degree of non-compliances in relation to cross-compliance should lead to an increase of the number of the on-the-spot checks during the following year in order to reach an acceptable level of assurance of the correctness of the aid applications concerned.

Very pleasant, but, but, but no fireworks.
None.
What are we gonna do?
We will figure something out.

She's getting married today, Maurice.
Your Highness, we're running very late.
Here, have a wishbone.
What do you wish?
I wish there was some meat on this.
Those last two were particularly satisfying.
It felt like having a go at the real Queen and Prince Albert.
It was the real Queen and Prince Albert.
Don't be ludicrous, Baldrick.
What would the Queen be doing here?
She come to visit you to reward you for being the nicest man in England by giving you £50,000 It couldn't have been the Queen because when she visits people, she leaves her Royal Seal.
Hello?
Oh,Joy!

Wake up and smell the coffee.

Born a perv. He'll die a perv.
Mom, are you okay?
It's just that I know it's sadness that's brought you here.
And I probably shouldn't say this, but... I'm so happy you're here.
I've missed you so much.
And you never visit.
Whatever happened to "just plain hot"? Hmm?
Yep, it's JB Bernstein.
Why are you giving me hard time?

Great.
Okay.

that the reference value has been met by a wide margin support a positive assessment of the fulfilment of the price stability criterion.
The other countries satisfying this criterion are Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Sweden.
Public finances: debt and deficit levels Lithuania is not the subject of a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit (under Article 126(6) of the Treaty).
In Lithuania the general government deficit-to-GDP ratio declined from 5.5% in 2011 to 2.1% in 2013 and is projected to remain at 2.1% in 2014 according to the Commission's Spring 2014 Economic Forecast.
The general government debt stood at 39.4% of GDP at end-2013, well below the Maastricht limits.
The other countries satisfying this criterion are Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Sweden.
The Czech Republic will also fulfil the criterion if the Council decides to abrogate the excessive deficit procedure, as proposed by the Commission.
Two Member States (Croatia and Poland) are still subject to an excessive deficit procedure and hence do not fulfil the criterion.
Exchange rate stability In the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II), the exchange rate of a non-euro area Member State is fixed against the euro and is only allowed to fluctuate within set limits (standard fluctuation bands being +/-15% around the central rate).
Lithuania has been a member of the ERM II since 28 June 2004.
In the two-year reference period, the Lithuanian litas has not been subject to any tensions and there has been no deviation from the ERM II central rate.
No other country currently satisfies this criterion as no other Member State is in ERM II.
As a consequence, only limited data are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised.

You know how this company works, Mr. Bishop.
Only two partners know the details of any given job.
Two people knew the details here.
Me and Harry McKenna.
Harry sold us out.
We pulled his financials.
Take a lookat recent offshore deposits.
There's one there on two weeks ago twenty million US dollars.
He's gotten old.
He's gotten weak.
They made him vulnerable.
But Harry McKenna has poisoned the well.
He needs to be removed.
Immediately.
You resemble a prince… … the prince of the idiots.
Hey, the weapons go against the rules!
Leave your katana.
Really?
Ouais, it is a play of ball!
In any event the result will be the same one.
It is what?
The ball “Sanji” of the team of the hat of straw is ready for the kickoff.
Crush them, Big Bang!
The encouragements become intense!
Maybe we can find him in here.
George Judd.
There he is, that's him there.
When he told him there was an elephant leech clinging to his bollocks, he got such a fright, he completely fainted.
Is that you?
No, I'm the wee one.
So who's that?
How could I forget?
Dip me in vinegar and call me a fish supper.
Ta-dah!
Here he comes, weaving his magic.
And he's clean through...
Foul!
Come on! I hardly touched you!
And so it begins.
You can't blame me for trying.

You, captain.

Baird, she's here.
Here?
Where?
I mean, is she okay?
She's annoyed with me, so, yeah, she's fine.
She wants us to go that way.
Col. Baird, the source of the circuit is that way.
So I think that's where we can find out what's causing this?
I think she wants you to go on ahead and for me to follow her this way.
Good plan.
I can take care of myself.
Are you implying I can't?
No, Baird is.
'play' and 'ball' and he's already said them.
Why, somebody dying?
Your fixing to forfeit.
Reason with these guys?
See what you can do.
I'm not going to argue with you.

The Archchancellor polished his staff as he walked along.
It was a particularly good one, six feet long and quite magical.
Not that he used magic very much.
In his experience, anything that couldn't be disposed of with a couple of whacks from six feet of oak was probably immune to magic as well.

No.
Sorry.
Please?
She panicked before, and now shes dying to go up.
Ill pay you.
Maam, I have to go to Baton Rouge.

Then I hope she talks soon.

Yeah, I was on break, had some time.
Sorry I drew a blank on the wife.

So, this is Claudia.
Claudia's rich husband also died young.

Mr White was already raising the axe as he turned round.
But you just can't trust a body.
Glad you're OK, sir.
Thanks, Fisher.
We were getting a bit worried about you, sir.

I'll tell you something - strictly between you and I - I'm scared stiff, and it's no good pretending I'm not.
Brace up.
But he'd settle for some black bread and butter, which he did have in his track, three hundred meters to the north.

The fox had at least looked into the woods to the east, probably listened for the sound of diesel engines, but heard nothing but the chirping of birds.
Still, this Chink lieutenant was the more conscientious of the two, in Buikov's opinion.
They should kill him first, when the time came, the sergeant thought.
Aleksandrov tapped the sergeant on the shoulder.
"Our turn to leapfrog, Boris Yevgeniyevich."
"By your command, Comrade Captain."
And both men moved out, crouching for the first hundred meters, and taking care not to make too much noise, until they heard the Chinese tracks start their engines.
Then you start adding larger stuff - clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens... your TV...
Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable No.1 Gold Club status in years in the program. They are literally moving mountains to see you in a Sebring.
We came up with this master plan, which was for me... ...to put gauze, to put bandages on both my hands. Then we got on the plane, transatlantic, flying to erm...Zurich. I waited till it was dark, and I walked up to the bathroom with her.

The arrangements spontaneously changed, minute by minute, without any apparent communication among the individual animals -- like the transient weavings of a moire pattern.
The Tymbrimi explained that an ancient Galactic race that had dwelt on Cathrhennlin ages ago had programmed the patterns into the Clideu as a form of puzzle.
No one in all time since had ever managed to decipher the riddle, if there actually was one.
Gillian suggested that the patterns might have been adapted by the Clideu for their own benefit.
The puzzle loving Tymbrimi preferred to think otherwise.
I mean, she probably won't even remember you.

How?

Just trust me.
There's no doubt about it.

Yeah.
