ing the vessel with a record of the use of equipment belonging to one of the groups of gear defined in point 3, may be authorised to use other gear facilities provided that the number of days allocated to that second device is at least equal to the number of days allocated to the first device.
. Plava flying the flag of a Member State which does not have quotas defined in point 1, shall not be in this area by using equipment belonging to one of the groups of fishing gear defined in point 3, where quota is not allocated on the basis of a transfer in accordance with Article 20(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 and if not allocated to the sea days under point 13 of this Annex.

. It is not necessary that the question is raised by the parties themselves; the national court may also be able to submit it without a proposal.
. Request for a preliminary ruling concerning interpretation Each court has jurisdiction to refer the Court a question to the Court of Justice concerning the interpretation of the rules of Community law, provided that it considers necessary to resolve the dispute submitted to it.
. In contrast, the court whose decisions cannot be challenged by means of national law is in principle required to submit a question to the Court, unless there is a case-law in the field (and any new framework does not raise real doubts as to the possibility of applying this case-law) or is the correct way of interpretation of Community rules completely obvious.
. The Court of First Instance, whose decisions may be challenged by remedies, so may, in particular if the case-law is sufficiently clarified under the Court’s case-law, to decide on the correct interpretation of Community law and the use of the facts made on it.
. The reference for a preliminary ruling may however be shown in a suitable stage of the procedure as particularly useful if it is a new issue of interpretation which is of general importance for the uniform application of Community law in the Union or where the current case-law does not appear to be applicable to a completely new factual framework.
. The national court is responsible for explaining what the interpretation required is necessary to interpret its judgment is necessary.
. Request for a preliminary ruling concerning the validity of the national courts If they are entitled to refuse to refuse the grounds relating to annulment before them, the possibility of declaring the Community act invalid falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
. Each national court must therefore refer to the Court a reference for a preliminary ruling if it has doubts on the validity of the Community act, with a view to which the Community act could be liable to be invalidated.
. However, if the national court has serious doubts as to the validity of the Community act based on a national act, it may exceptionally suspend the temporarily implementation of the latter act or in that regard take any other precautionary measure.
. It is then required to ask the question concerning the validity of the Court and to state the reasons why the Community act is not valid.
. When submitting a reference for a preliminary ruling, the national court may submit a reference to a preliminary ruling, once it finds that the decision on the question or questions of interpretation or validity is necessary to give judgment to the judgment in the national court which may best assess the proceedings at which such a request is to be submitted.
. However, it is desirable that the decision to refer the question referred for a preliminary ruling is adopted in the proceedings where the court is able to define the factual and legal framework of the problem so that the Court should have any evidence necessary, where appropriate, to verify that Community law in the main proceedings is applicable.
. It can also be shown in order to ensure the proper exercise of justice so that the question referred for a preliminary ruling is submitted after the contractor's case.
. In the form of a reference for a preliminary ruling The decision which the national court considers a preliminary ruling to the Court may be adopted in any form which national law allows for procedural issues in the case of procedural issues.
. However, it must be noted that this document, which is the basis for the proceedings which takes place before the Court of Justice and that the Court must have evidence available to it which it will allow it to give it a useful answer to the national court.

ally, as with other antiagreganic agents, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients with potential risk of increased bleeding after trauma, operation or due to other pathological conditions and, if concomitant administration of clopidogrel and ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or non-steroidal anti-flogistics (NSAID) including cox-2 inhibitors or selective serotonin re-treatment inhibitors (SRI).
patients should be closely monitored if they do not appear to have any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or invasive cardiological performance or operation.
ating clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may increase bleeding intensity (see section 4.5).
. If the patient is to undergo an operation and antiagregatory effect is not temporarily desirable, clopidogrel should be discontinued within 7 days prior to performance.
. Patients should be advised to inform the doctor and dental doctor before planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy that they take clopidogrel before planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy.
ally, clopidogrel extends bleeding time and should therefore be administered to patients with tendency to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular) cautiously.
. 4 Patients should be informed that if they take clopidogrel (same or in combination with ASA), the bleeding ban would take longer than usual and that they should have had any unusual bleeding (depending or length) to inform their doctor.
ally reported thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) Trombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was reported very rarely after saving clopidogrel after saving, sometimes short exposure.
. It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction or fever.
. TTP is potentially fatal condition requiring unsensified treatment including plasmaheresis.
ated haemophilia Following the use of clopidogrel, the received haemophilia has been reported.
. If the only occurrence of the prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with bleeding or without it, the possibility of obtained haemophilia should be taken into account.
. Patients with confirmed diagnosis obtained by haemophilia should be treated with a specialist doctor and clopidogrel administration should be discontinued.
orative stroke In view of the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days after acute ischaemic stroke of the brain.

. Completion of the harmonised framework for mapping Up to improve comparability of strategic noise mapping, the situation is far from ideal.
ually, it is apparent from ongoing evaluation that it is still difficult to submit comparable data on the number of persons exposed to excessive noise levels.
. The difficulties are related, inter alia, with different data collection methods, quality and availability of data and evaluation methods used, including the different ways of collecting data, qualitative and availability.
. This is the cause of different results in EU Member States. It is the cause of different results in EU Member States.
. The comparability level will ultimately lead the harmonisation framework(s) that will sufficiently reflect the sectoral specifications.

ing the creation of a legal and fiscal environment that is favourable to businesses In order to benefit from our businesses all the opportunities offered by the Single Market, including freedom of establishment, the rules on which the Single Market is based, simple, adapted and must meet the problems encountered by businesses in daily activities.
. The measures proposed in this section are calculated, inter alia, by reducing administrative and regulatory burden, including with positive impacts on growth and job creation[17].
ally, concrete initiatives will be taken to ensure the interconnection of the registers of commercial companies and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union.
. The issues of fiscal are also essential.
. Initiatives in corporate taxation or VAT, administrative burdens should limit the administrative burden of undertakings and facilitate their cross-border activities.
. Furthermore, it deserves particular attention to the defence and security sector, since they encourage development and growth throughout the economy as a result of their top technologies, innovation and know-how.
. 19 : The Commission will take initiatives to improve coordination of national fiscal policies, in particular by the proposal for a directive to create a common consolidated basis for corporate taxation (CZS) in 2011.
. 27 The current national systems of taxation in the EU are large differences, creating significant fiscal obstacles to cross-border activities of companies, or even precludes this activity.
ing fragmentation leads to a significant market disruption and the cost of putting into conformity with the provisions.
. This concerns in particular SMEs, often which are necessary to overcome these deficiencies, and can deter them from developing a single market.
. The introduction of a common consolidated corporate tax base is intended to address the issue of fiscal provisions which limit growth.
. companies groups should only manage the only rules set of fiscal matters and should act only with one fiscal management throughout the EU (uniform Contact Point").
. Turnover should be consolidated at group level and losses should be deducted from profits irrespective of the border.
. Dual taxation or double tax relief due to differences or incompatibility between national fiscal rules would be excluded in the relationships within groups.
. The uncoordinated national action would only reproduce the current situation, since companies would still be confronted with so many fiscal systems, as many states in which they operate.
. 107 In this context, it should be noted that Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1515/2001 provides that, if the dispute resolution authority adopts a report concerning non-contractive measures, the Council may, if deemed appropriate, repeal or amend the contested measures or adopt other appropriate specific measures in order to take into account the legal interpretations in it.
. According to recital 5 of the preamble to that regulation, the EU institutions may consider appropriate to repeal or amend measures adopted under the basic Regulation, including those not subject to dispute resolution proceedings within the framework of the Memorandum to the rules and procedures governing dispute resolution, or to take other specific measures taking into account the legal interpretation contained in the report adopted by the dispute resolution authority.
. 108 Secondly, as the applicant rightly states, the provisions of EU law must be interpreted as far as possible in the light of international law, in particular where the international agreement concluded by the Community, such as the basic regulation adopted to comply with international obligations arising from the anti-dumping Agreement (see recital 3 of the basic Regulation).

. 42 By not referring Article 2 of the Decision on a Community decision establishing non-conceptional criteria for the choice of procedural conditions to be complied with, under the appellant in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance wrongly stated that the regulatory procedure can only be applied to measures of general scope.
. – Arguments of the Commission 43 The Commission considers that the reference to the 30th recital in the preamble to Regulation No 3319/4 is not relevant for the purposes of interpreting Article 1(3) of that regulation, which imposes a specific duty, where two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of indirect invoicing and imports of ZAP.
. 44 As regards Article 2 of the Decision on the Community, the Commission contests the CMF’s assertion that the Court of First Instance has stated that the regulatory procedure can only be used for measures of general scope.
. The Court’s conclusions 45 By the two part of the appeal examined and, therefore, the very plea in law itself, have no separate existence, that reason.
. 47 As the Advocate General points out in paragraph 41 of his Opinion, both parts of the appeal are more specific to the fourth, third ground of appeal, which is contested by the Court of First Instance’s own legal analysis.
. 48 That part of the appeal is therefore consistent with the fourth, respective to third ground of appeal.
. 49 Consequently, it is not necessary to examine them individually.
. In order to reiterate the appellant’s appeal based on the distortion of the facts Arguments of the parties – Arguments of the appellants 50 CMF claims that the Court of First Instance adopted, in paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, in which the facts are reiterated, the Court adopted a totally fictional legal structure of the competent national authorities regarding the existence of indirect invoicing.
. 51 That performance is incomplete and wrong, and thus leads to distortion of facts.

. In that regard, it is sufficient that the common component is not negligible.
. 57 However, it must be noted that the Court of First Instance stated that the overall impression which triggered the mark applied for is dominated by the ‘creacies kennya’ element to which the consumer concerned focuses its attention in a broad extent and, secondly, in particular, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘ck’ element in relation to the element ‘creaciones kennya’ is only an intervener, which essentially concludes that ‘ck’ element is negligible in the mark applied for.
. 58 The Court of First Instance, which, on the basis of the correct analysis, ruled out any similarity between the marks in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, has rightly concluded that despite the good name of earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.
. 59 The third part of the first plea must therefore be declared unfounded.
. 60 In those circumstances, the first plea must be rejected in law.
. The second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By their second ground of appeal, the appellant complains that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, when it did not examine the good name of earlier marks in the context of that provision.
. 62 The Court of First Instance inferred that, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, the appellant alleges a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, whereas the action was expressly based on infringement of Article 8(5) of this Regulation.
. 63 The Court of First Instance erred in law in finding that, since the conflicting marks are similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of earlier marks.
. The fact that the earlier mark of CK Calvin Klein is generally known is to be taken into account in the appellant for determining whether more extensive protection should be granted to it.
. Good name of the earlier mark must be assessed in the assessment of similarity between the marks in the marks and not after similarity has been demonstrated.
. 64 In that regard, the appellant claims that if the famous CK mark would be protected only if the third parties ‘cK’ would have used the same graphic representation, it would mean that the CK mark would be granted a level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection that would have been not known in general.
. The fact that the trade mark of the CK and other different graphic representation of those letters is well known to them is to protect them against the use of the ‘CC’ in the fashion sector, since this point identifies Calvin Klein Klein, so that their use of a third party is confusing confusion through association.
. 65 OHIM claims that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance has rightly ruled on the question of the good name of the earlier mark in the judgment under appeal.
. Since the signs at issue cannot be regarded as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 shall not apply.
. 66 Zafra Marroquineros states that the reference to the good name of the earlier marks is made in the judgment under appeal.

. implementation rules should be laid down in this system.
. The checks of conditionality may be completed before the payment and annual premiums pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receiving them.
. In particular, where such checks cannot be completed before receiving these payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of administrative sanctions should be made in accordance with this Regulation or by starting.
. rules should be laid down in the rules concerning authorities in the Member States responsible for the control system of obligations on conditionality.
. minimum control rate should be established for the verification of the obligations relating to conditionality.
. This control rate should be fixed at least at 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, which fall within the scope of the competent control authorities and which must be selected on the basis of adequate risk analysis.
. For the purpose of calculating the control sample, in the special case of the group of persons under Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, Member States should be granted flexibility in determining whether the group will assess as a whole or any member of the group individually.
ing Member States should be able to choose whether the minimum level of checks at each competent control authority, at the level of paying agency or at the level of the act or standards, or the set of acts or standards.
. If specific legislation applicable to acts or standards lays down minimum control rates, Member States should comply with these rates.
. However, Member States should be allowed to use a uniform control rate for the on-the-spot checks on conditionality.
. If Member States choose this option, all cases of non-compliance identified during the on-the-spot checks under sector legislation should be reported and followed under conditionality.
. To simplify the obligation on conditionality obligations in relation to Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the application of the specific level of sampling from the monitoring plans should be considered as fulfilling the requirement of a minimum rate laid down in this Regulation.
. Member States should be granted flexibility necessary to achieve a minimum control rate by using results from other on-the-spot checks or by replacing beneficiaries.
ing the control system to avoid weakening, in particular as regards the selection of sampling on the spot on conditionality, the minimum control sample should not be taken into account when calculating the minimum control sample on conditionality, the subsequent checks carried out in relation to the de minimis rule referred to in Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
. Find out a significant degree of non-compliance in the context of conditionality should lead to an increase in the number of on-the-spot checks to achieve an acceptable level of security in relation to the correctness of the applications for aid in question.
