The main objective of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) in the field of active and healthy ageing is to increase the average life expectancy in the EU by 2020 by two years.
Partnership aims to improve the quality of life of older citizens and more effective health care solutions.
will focus on the use of innovation at a larger scale than it is now, in such areas such as the promotion of health, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, integrated health and social care systems based on cooperation and assistant technologies.
The Commission will analyse the analysis of the consultation to obtain a clear view of the potential and capacity of innovation in different areas that have an impact on ageing at today.
The European Innovation Partnership approach is then planned to follow the response from these responses.
The online consultation is also held with the conference on the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, which is held in Brussels today.
discusses its views on the way to transform partnerships into specific actions.
The European Innovation Partnership's Elevator Partnership is part of the EU's "Innovation" strategy, one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, aiming to transform ideas in jobs, green growth and social progress (IP/10/1288).
The Union has a three-strength goal: to enable Europe to achieve scientific results at world level, to substantially change the way of cooperation between the public and private sectors, especially through innovation partnership, and to remove obstacles (such as cost patents, market fragmentation, slow deployment of standards and poor skills) that currently prevent rapid market penetration of ideas.

initiatives aimed at regional cooperation in nutrition areas should be strengthened as regards Asia.
The harmonisation of EU intervention Access to food security in developing countries must be based on the principles of the Paris Declaration on the effectiveness of the assistance, the Action Programme of the EU and the Code of EU rules as regards work works in the field of development policy.
Member States should, according to their comparative advantages, identify regions and countries in relation to which they should divide their work and coordinate their activities under the direction of a specific principal donor.
The EU and the Member States have several political frameworks and financial instruments available to partner countries to help address food security problems with food security problems.
enhanced effectiveness of their measures should help to harmonise policies, more closely linked to tools and coordination with private investors.

reforms of the common agricultural policy reform have been strengthened and future reforms will be taken into account global food security objectives.
The future reform of the common fisheries policy will further increase the coherence of European fisheries policies and fisheries methods on the one hand and development objectives, on the other hand.
, not least, achieving balanced, comprehensive and ambitious results of the development programme from Doha has strengthened the international trading system, which would have a favourable impact on food security.
enhancing the coherence of the EU's international management system and Member States should better align the way that food security is managed internally and promote a rapid reform of the Food Safety Committee in the world (CFS) which is a central body in that area.
The Committee should seek to ensure the power of supervision in other specific areas affecting food security, e.g. food aid and nutrition in food and nutrition.
furthermore, the priorities of the three UN agencies with their seat in Rome (FAO, WFP, IFAD) and the synergy should be improved in order to ensure synergies, their mutual cooperation should also be improved.
The UN reform and ongoing review of the role and priorities of the FAO are opportunities to increase quality and efficiency.

The question is not necessary to be raised by the parties themselves; the national judge may also place it without the proposal.
The reference for a preliminary ruling on interpretation Each court concerned has jurisdiction to refer to the Court of Justice the question relating to the interpretation of Community law rule, if it deems it necessary to address the dispute before it.
– By contrast, the court whose decision cannot be challenged by the remedies under national law, it is essentially required to submit to the Court that question, unless there is a case-law (and any new framework does not establish actual doubts as to the possibility of applying this case-law) or is the correct way of interpreting the Community rules completely evident.
. The Court of First Instance, which can be contested by remedies, in particular if the case is sufficiently clarified on the basis of the case-law of the Court, may decide on the correct interpretation of Community law and its use on the basis of the facts made.
The reference for a preliminary ruling may, however, be shown in the appropriate stage of the procedure as particularly useful as regards a new question of interpretation which has a general meaning for the uniform application of Community law in the Union or, if the current case-law does not appear to be applicable to a completely new factual framework.
The national court is for the purpose of explaining what is required to interpret the interpretation necessary to order its judgment.
The reference for a preliminary ruling concerning the validity of the application If national courts have the possibility to refuse the pleas in law relating to invalidity before them, the possibility of declaring the Community act as invalid falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court.
The Court must therefore refer to the Court a reference for a preliminary ruling, if the Community measure has doubts as to the validity of the measure, to which it considers that the Community act could be invalid.
, however, if the national judge has serious doubts as to the validity of the Community measure on which the national act is based, it may exceptionally suspend temporarily the implementation of the latter act or, in that regard, take any other precautionary measure.
The question is then required to refer to the Court and to state reasons why the Community measure is not valid.
The Court may, at the time when the request for a preliminary ruling is made to the Court, as soon as it finds that the decision on the question or questions of interpretation or validity is necessary to enable it to be delivered; it is the national court which may best assess, in which case, the proceedings are to be made.
The decision to refer for a preliminary ruling is however desirable to adopt a procedure at the stage of the procedure where the court is able to define the facts and legal framework of the problem so that the Court should have all the information necessary to verify that Community law is applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings.
may also be shown in order to ensure the proper administration of justice, to provide a preliminary ruling after the contradictory discussion of the case.
. In order to make a reference for a preliminary ruling, the decision on a preliminary ruling by the national court may be adopted in any form which national law permits procedural issues in the case of procedural matters.
In mind, however, it must be held that this document is the basis for proceedings which will be carried out before the Court and that the Court must have the evidence available to him to enable him to give a useful answer to the national court.

if the 10-year limitation period should start running until the transposition of APSA vaccines to the Ministry of Health, the precise moment of the sale of APMSD vaccines should be determined to set the date of the start of the limitation period.
, irrespective of whether, under this assumption, the limitation period for APSA was temporarily suspended by bringing an action against APMSD ( 36 ) , the judicial proceedings against APSA would be instituted in any event before the 10-year period of time when the vaccine was placed in circulation on 16 October 1992 ( 37 ) .

, if APSA could only define that moment as a certain period starting over 10 years before the application, but it ends less than ten years before it was lodged, APSA would not only be a burden of proof but also a probative risk of determining the precise moment of opening the limitation period.
, even if the precise moment of circulation was not specified, the court proceedings would be initiated in any event in time and therefore the effects of the interruption of the limitation period should therefore be initiated in time and the effects of the interruption of the limitation period.

with caution in patients with potential risk of increased haemorrhage, trauma, surgery or due to other pathological conditions and in the case of clopidogrel and ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-flogistics (NSAID) including cox-2 inhibitors or selective re-dispensation inhibitors (SRI).
patients should be carefully monitored whether any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiological surgery or surgery are not appearing therein.
-administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may increase bleeding intensity (see section 4.5).
7 days prior to performance, if the patient is to undergo the planned operation and anti-agregatory effect is not temporarily desirable, clopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days before the exercise.
patients should tell the physician and dentist that clopidogrel should be used prior to planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy to the physician and dentistically.
patients with tendency to bleed (especially gastrointestinal and intraocular) should therefore be administered cautiously.
4 Patients should be informed that if they use clopidogrel (as alone or in combination with ASA), the arrest of bleeding could take longer than usual and that they should have any unusual bleeding (looking the occurrence or length) to inform their doctor.
Trombocytopenic purpura (TTTP) Trombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely after clopidogrel use, sometimes after short exposure.
is characterised by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated either with neurological findings, renal dysfunction or fever.
TP is potentially fatal condition requiring immediate treatment including plasmaferésis.
haemophilia Following the use of clopidogrel, haemophilia obtained has been reported.
where an extended occurrence of activated partial thromboplastine time (aPTT) with bleeding or without bleeding is confirmed, the possibility of hemophilia obtained is to be taken into account.
patients with confirmed diagnosis obtained by haemophilia should be treated with specialist physician and clopidogrel administration should be completed.
recent stroke Since clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days after acute ischemical stroke.

The Commission intends to submit to the Committee on the noise referred to in Article 13 of the Work Programme Directive, which contains one of the elements below, which is intended to submit to the Committee on the noise referred to in Article 13 of the Work Programme.
, if necessary, the Commission will also consider whether it would give rise to the action to complement the active implementation of the activities described below.
efining the harmonised mapping framework, despite improving the comparability of strategic noise mapping, the situation is far from ideal.
shows that the figures on the number of persons exposed to excessive noise levels are still difficult to submit comparable figures on the number of persons exposed to excessive noise levels.
. The difficulties are, inter alia, with different data collection methods, quality and availability of data and evaluation methods used.
, this is the cause of different results in the EU Member States in the Member States.
The comparability level will ultimately lead the harmonisation framework(s) that will adequately reflect the sectoral specifications.
In 2008, the Commission began to work on the development of harmonised noise exposure assessment methods (under Article 6(2)), under Article 6(2)).
The project entitled ‘CNOSSOS-EU’ (Common Method of Evaluation of noise in Europe) which leads the Joint Research Centre, shall ensure the technical basis for the preparation of the Commission Implementing Decision.
, provided that technical work can be completed in 2011, the Commission considers possible revision of Annex II to the Rural Directive at the beginning of 2012 (thefter the 2011 Committee gives its opinion in 2011.
-fixed methodological framework could focus on strategic mapping and would have to carefully balance the needs of harmonisation in adequacy and sectoral specificities, e.g. as regards data requirements.
The Commission intends to propose a joint work programme of the Commission/European Environment Agency/Member States to implement the CNOSSOS-EU project in 2012-2015, in order to make this project functional for third cycle reporting in 2017.
The development of the implementation of the EU Guidelines The number of aspects of the directive has not been detailed or left space for different interpretations and implementation.
many Member States have proposed that these issues be addressed through specific actions to help implement and comply with EU level compliance, such as the development of documents with guidance, exchange of information on best practices or organising specific workshops and training courses.
-specific actions could focus on the following issues: mapping and best practices, forecasts for noise maps, relationships between dose and response, calculation of repeated exposure, formation of action plans and admissible or target values.

-fixed and fiscal environment that is favourable to businesses In order to benefit from all the opportunities offered by the Single Market, including freedom of establishment, the rules on which the single market is based, simple, adapted and must meet the challenges faced by businesses in daily activities.
The measures proposed in this section are, inter alia, with reduced administrative and regulatory burden, with positive effects on growth and job creation[17].
In this context, the specific initiatives will be adopted to ensure interconnection of trade registers and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union.
, the issues of fiscal concern are also essential.
Initiatives in corporate taxation or VAT should limit administrative burdens on businesses and facilitate their cross-border activities.
ware sectors of defence and security, also deserve particular attention to the defence sector, as they stimulate development and growth throughout the economy due to their high technology, innovation and know-how.
. 19 : The Commission will adopt initiatives to improve the coordination of national fiscal policies, in particular the proposal for a directive to establish a common consolidated corporate taxation base (CZS) in 2011.
21069 existing national corporate taxation systems exist large differences, which creates significant fiscal obstacles to cross-border activities of companies, or even prevent this activity.
fragmentation leads to significant market distortions and to the emergence of costs of placing in accordance with the provisions.
SMEs, which often meet the necessary resources to overcome these shortcomings, and can discourage them from developing in the single market.
The establishment of a common consolidated corporate taxation base is to address the problem of fiscal provisions which limit growth.
should only be managed in fiscal matters only by a single set of rules and only one fiscal administration across the EU (the unified contact point) should be negotiated with one fiscal administration throughout the EU (the unified contact point”).
should be consolidated at group level and losses should be deducted from profits regardless of the border.
The cases of double taxation or double exemption due to differences or incompatibility between national fiscal rules would be excluded in relations within groups.
-coordinated national measures would only be reproduced by the current situation, since companies would still be confronted with so many fiscal systems, as the States in which they operate.
107 In that regard, it should be recalled that Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1515/2001 provides that, if the dispute resolution authority adopts a report concerning the non-contested measure, the Council may, if deemed appropriate, annul or amend the contested measures or adopt other appropriate specific measures to take account of legal interpretations in it formulated.
. 5 of the preamble to that Regulation, the European Union institutions may consider appropriate cancel or amend measures taken under the basic Regulation, including those not subject to dispute resolution proceedings under the Memorandum Agreement on the rules and procedures governing disputes, or to take other specific measures taking into account the legal interpretation contained in the report adopted by the SPC.
The second, as the applicant rightly points out, the provisions of EU law must be interpreted as far as possible in the light of international law, in particular where the objective of these provisions is to implement an international agreement concluded by the Community, such as the basic Regulation adopted to meet international commitments arising from the anti-dumping agreement (see recital 3 of the basic Regulation).

( 42 By failing to state Article 2 of the Comitology Decision which provides for non-binding criteria for the choice of procedural conditions to be complied with, according to the appellants in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal, it has not been right to state that the regulatory procedure can be used only for measures with general scope.
– Arguments of the Commission 43 The Commission considers that the ninth recital in the preamble to Regulation No 3319/94 is not relevant for the purposes of interpreting Article 1(3) of that regulation, which imposes specific duty, if two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of an indirect invoice and imports of the product of ZAP.
14 As regards Article 2 of the Comitology Decision, the Commission contests the CMF’s assertion that the regulatory procedure can be used only for measures with general scope.
– The Court’s conclusion 45 Both parts of the appeal examined and, therefore, the ground of appeal itself, and that is to say, the ground of appeal, have no separate existence.
, as the Advocate General points out in paragraph 41 of his Opinion, both parts of the appeals examined are more specific in the fourth, respect of the third ground of appeal, which is called into question by the Court of First Instance.
’s fourth, the fourth, respect for the third ground of appeal is therefore coincided with the third ground of appeal.
49 Consequently, it must not be examined separately. 49 Consequently, it is not necessary to examine them separately.
– Arguments of the appellants 50 CMF claims that the Court of First Instance, in paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, in which the facts of the case are repeated, adopted a completely fictional legal structure of the competent national authorities as regards the existence of an indirect invoicing.

. In that regard, it is sufficient that the common component is not negligible.
– first, the Court of First Instance stated that the overall impression which produces the mark applied for is dominated by the element ‘creacities kennya’ on which the consumer concerned is to focus on a wide extent, and, second, in particular, paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal that the element ‘creacities kennya’ is ‘creacities’ in relation to the element ‘creacities’ is only an intervening position, which, in essence, implies that the element ‘ck’ is negligible in the mark applied for.
, in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance ruled out that, despite the good name of the earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.
59 Third part of the first plea must therefore be declared unfounded.
first plea in law must be rejected in those circumstances.
The second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By its second ground of appeal, the appellant of the Court criticises that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 when he did not examine the good name of the earlier marks under that provision.
, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance doubted, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, that the appellant claims that the single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, while the action was specifically based on infringement of Article 8(5) of that Regulation.
63 The Court of First Instance erroneously committed errors of law in finding that, since the marks which are similar are not, it must not be examined by the good name of the earlier marks.
. The fact that the earlier mark of Calvin Klein is generally known should be taken into account in the appellants for the purposes of determining whether it is necessary to grant more extensive protection.
. Good name of the earlier mark must be assessed in assessing the similarity between marks and not after the similarity has been shown.
64 In that regard, the appellant claims that if the pro-recise mark is protected only if the third party would use the ‘cK’ in the same way the graphic formulation would mean that the trade mark of the CK with a good name would be granted a level of protection which is practically less than the level of protection which would have been used if it were not generally known.
The fact that the mark of the CK and other distinct graphic designation of those letters is famous is to give them protection against the use of the ‘CC’ in the fashion sector, as those letters identify Calvin Klein, so that their use by a third party produces confusion through the association.
, in the judgment under appeal, OHIM claims that the Court of First Instance has held the right to the good name of the earlier mark.
As the signs at issue cannot be regarded as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 does not apply.
Zafra Marroquineros states that, in the judgment under appeal, a reference to the good name of the earlier marks is made in the earlier judgment.

rules should be laid down in the Member States responsible for the control system of the cross-compliance obligations.
minimum control level should be fixed for verification of the cross-compliance obligations.
. This control rate should at least 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 which fall within the scope of the competent control authorities and which must be selected on the basis of an appropriate risk analysis.
should be granted to Member States in the specific case of a group of persons under Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 to flexibility in determining whether the group will be assessed individually.
Member States should be able to choose whether to meet the minimum level of controls at the level of each competent control body, at the paying agency level or at the level of the act or standards, or a set of acts or standards.
, where specific legislation applicable to acts or standards lays down minimum control rates, Member States should comply with these rates.
