will focus on the use of innovation in a larger scale than now, in areas such as health promotion, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, integrated health and social care systems based on cooperation, as well as assisting technologies.
. The Commission will analyse the responses to the consultation to obtain a clear view of the potential and capacity of innovation in various areas that have an impact on ageing in today.
. On the basis of these answers, there is a further procedure in the European Innovation Partnership.
. online consultation also takes place with the European Innovation Conference on active and healthy ageing, held in Brussels today.
. More than 150 stakeholder representatives discuss their views on it how to transform partnerships into specific acts.
. The European Innovation Partnership for Innovation in active and healthy ageing is part of the EU's strategy "Union innovation", which is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy to transform ideas into jobs, environmental growth and social progress (IP/10/1288).
. Innovation Union has three objectives: allowing Europe to achieve scientific results at world level, to alter the way of cooperation between public and private sectors, in particular through innovation partnerships, and eliminate obstacles (such as costly patents, market fragmentation, slow deployment of standards and insufficient qualifications) currently preventing rapid penetration of ideas on the market.
. This corresponds to the objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe fully exploiting ICT potential and to promote prosperity and improve the quality of life (see IP/10/581, MEMO/10/199 and MEMO/10/200).

. As regards Asia, initiatives aimed at regional cooperation should be strengthened.
. Harmonisation of EU intervention Access to food security in developing countries must be based on the principles of the Paris Declaration on the effectiveness of the assistance, Action Programme of Action and the EU Code with regard to the work on development policy.
. EU and Member States should identify regions and countries in terms of their comparative advantages in relation to which work should be divided and coordinated under the management of a specific principal donor.
. EU and Member States have several policy frameworks and financial instruments that can help partner countries deal with food security problems.
uster effectiveness of their measures should promote greater harmonisation of policies, more closely linked to instruments and coordination with private investors.
. policies in favour of development[26] in the field of food security will be developed through a range of political instruments including agriculture, trade, fisheries, fight against climate change, environmental protection and research.
. This coherence has been strengthened by reforming the common agricultural policy and future reforms will take into account global food security objectives.
ating reform of the Common Fisheries Policy will further increase the coherence of European fisheries policies and fisheries methods on the one hand and the development objectives on the other hand.
. Finally, the achievement of balanced, comprehensive and ambitious results of the development programme from Doha would strengthen the international trading system, which would have a favourable impact on food security.
power the coherence of the EU's international governance system and Member States should better align the way food security is managed in international scale and to support the accelerated reform of the Committee on food security in the world (CFS), which is a central body in that area.
ed by the Committee should seek the power of supervision in other specific areas that affect food security, such as food aid and nutrition.

. The vessel with a record of the use of equipment belonging to one of the groups of fishing gear defined in point 3, may be authorised to use other gears provided that the number of days allocated to that second device is at least equal to the number of days allocated to the first device.
) the vessel flying the flag of a Member State which does not have quotas defined in point 1, shall not fish in this area with the use of equipment belonging to one of the groups of fishing gear defined in point 3, provided that quota is not allocated on the basis of the transfer in accordance with Article 20(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 and if the days at sea are not allocated under point 13 of this Annex.
. For vehicles with axles for lifting, the effect of this device should be taken into account.
. 2.3 ‘Maximum technically permissible weight on axle (m)’ means the mass corresponding to the maximum permitted static vertical load of the operating axle on the surface of the vehicle, the design and axle and the vehicle manufacturer.
. 2.4 ‘Maximum technically permissible weight on the axle group ( ⁇ )’: means the weight corresponding to the maximum permitted static vertical load of the operating group to the surface of the vehicle, the design and the group of axles and the vehicle manufacturer.
. 2.5 ‘Fuel weight’ means the total load operating on the surface of the axle/air of towed vehicles/ towed vehicles.
. 2.6 ‘Maximum technically permissible connection mass (TM)’: the maximum trailer shall be understood by the manufacturer.
. 2.7 ‘Maximum technically permissible mass operating at the point of the vehicle’ shall mean the mass corresponding to the maximum permitted static vertical load at the point of the concentration, the design of the vehicle and/or the coupling device and the manufacturer.

. It is not necessary that the question is raised by the parties themselves; the national court may also refer it without a proposal.
. Request for a preliminary ruling concerning interpretation Each court in question has jurisdiction to refer a question to the Court concerning the interpretation of the rules of Community law if it considers necessary to resolve the dispute submitted to it.
. In contrast, the court whose decisions cannot be challenged by remedies under national law is in principle obliged to submit a question to the Court, unless there is a case-law in the field (and any new framework raises real doubts as to the possibility of applying this case-law) or is the correct way of interpretation of the Community rules completely obvious.
. The Court of First Instance, whose decisions may be challenged by remedies, so may, in particular where the case-law is sufficiently clarified on the basis of the case-law of the Court of Justice, decide on the correct interpretation of Community law and the use of the facts made.
. However, the reference for a preliminary ruling may, in the appropriate stage of the proceedings, show as particularly useful if it is a new issue of interpretation which has a general meaning for the uniform application of Community law in the Union or where the current case-law does not appear to be applicable to a completely new factual framework.
. In the national court, it is for the national court to explain what the interpretation required is necessary to interpret its judgment.
. Request for a preliminary ruling concerning the validity assessment If the national courts have the possibility of refusing to refuse the grounds relating to annulment before them, the possibility of declaring the Community act invalid falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
. Each national court must therefore refer to the Court a reference for a preliminary ruling if it has doubts on the validity of the Community act, giving reasons for which it considers that the Community act could be affected by invalidity.
. However, if a national court has serious doubts as to the validity of a Community act based on a national act, it may exceptionally suspend temporarily the implementation of that act or in that regard take any other precautionary measure.
. It is then required to ask a question concerning the validity of the Court and to state the reasons why the Community act is not valid.
. When submitting a reference for a preliminary ruling, the national court may submit a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling as soon as it finds that the decision on the question or questions of interpretation or validity is necessary to give judgment to its judgment; it is a national court which may best assess in what stage of the proceedings must be submitted.
. However, it is desirable that the reference for a preliminary ruling is taken in the proceedings where the court is able to define the factual and legal framework of the problem so that the Court should have any information necessary, where appropriate, to verify that Community law in the main proceedings is applicable.
can also be shown in the interests of sound administration of justice in order to refer the question referred for a preliminary ruling after the contractor discussion of the case.
. The form of a reference for a preliminary ruling The decision which the national court asks for a preliminary ruling may be adopted in any form which national law allows for procedural issues.
. However, it should be noted that this document, which is the basis for the proceedings which takes place before the Court of Justice and that the Court must have a useful answer to the national court.

ing the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CRP) should not jeopardise the Member States which infringe its rules.
. According to Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) , financial assistance from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (ENRF) is subject to compliance with the rules of the CRP by Member States.
. failure to comply with the rules of the CRP Member States may result in interrupting or suspending payments or carrying out financial corrections to the Union financial assistance granted under the CRP.
. Article 83(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) provides for the conditions under which the suspension of payment may be imposed and in Article 142(1) of the same regulation.
. These two articles provide that, in respect of failure to comply with the rules under the CRP, specific rules for the ENRF may lay down specific grounds for interrupting and suspending payments.
. In order to protect the financial interests of the Union and its taxpayers if the Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the CRP, or if the Commission has evidence indicating such failure, the Commission has the possibility of interrupting the payment period under Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.
. In addition to the suspension of payment time and in order to avoid the risk of payment of ineligible expenditure, the Commission may, in the event of serious failure to comply with the CRP rules in accordance with Article 101 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, suspend payments.
. Financial implications of penalties imposed on Member States should be proportionate to the nature, gravity, duration and repeat of non-compliance rules.
. In order to ensure legal certainty for Member States carrying out operational programmes within the framework of the ENRF, cases of failure to comply with the rules of the CFP are essential to maintain marine biological resources which may, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, lead to the suspension of payment periods or suspension of payments.
. Without prejudice to all other sanctions imposed by the CRP rules, these cases will be used for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 and the implementation of Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
. Cases of non-compliance with the rules of the CRP, which are essential to maintain biological marine resources, should be considered serious if the Member State has not taken the necessary measures to remedy the situation resulting in the suspension of payment time.
. Before interrupting or suspending payments, the Commission must adopt implementing acts pursuant to Article 100(2) and 101(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, which further clarifies the failure to fulfil obligations under the CRP of a Member State which may affect expenditure for which an interim payment is sought.
. Since this Regulation should enter into force on the first day following the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union , HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
. Article 1 The consequences of failure to comply with the rules In the Annex to this Regulation shall be determined by cases of failure to fulfil the obligations of a Member State within the framework of the CRP which may lead to an interim payment period under Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.

. If the ten-year limitation period should begin to run until the transfer of APSA vaccine to the Ministry of Health, it would have to be determined by the precise moment of the sale of APMSD to the Ministry of Health to determine the date of the start of the limitation period.
, irrespective of whether, under this assumption, the limitation period for APSA would be interrupted in time by bringing an action against APMSD ( 36 ) on 16 October 2002, the judicial proceedings against APSA would be initiated in any event before the expiry of the 10-year period if the Ministry of Health referred to before the expiry of 16 October 1992).
. Even if it is no longer possible to determine the precise moment of the sale of the Ministry of Health, and it would only be possible to define it for a period between 22 September 1992 – the date of adoption of the vaccine in APMSD – and on 3 November 1992 – vaccination of the opponent – the initiation of the APSA proceeding on 16 October 2002 in any event of the limitation period should be interrupted in time.
. If APSA would have to show a moment of placing the vaccine into circulation.
. If APSA could only define this moment as a certain period starting for more than ten years before the application, APSA ends less than ten years before its submission, APSA should not only be the burden of proof, but also the proof of the exact moment of the initiation of the limitation period.
, even if it is not intended for a precise moment to be put into circulation, the court proceedings on 16 October 2002 would be initiated in any event in a timely manner and would therefore have the effect of interrupting the limitation period.

ally, in other antiagregania, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients with potential risk of increased bleeding after trauma, operation or due to other pathological conditions and in the case of concomitant administration of clopidogrel and ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or non-steroidal anti-flogistics (NSAID) including cox-2 inhibitors or selective serotonin re-treatment inhibitors (SRI).
patients should be closely monitored for any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or invasive cardiological performance or operation.
ating clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended because it may increase bleeding intensity (see section 4.5).
. If the patient has a planned operation and antiaggregation effect is not temporarily desirable, clopidogrel should be discontinued within 7 days prior to performance.
. Patients should advise any surgery or pharmacotherapy before planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy to inform the doctor and dental doctor that they take clopidogrel.
ally, clopidogrel extends bleeding time and should therefore be administered to patients with tendency to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular) cautiously.
. 4 Patients should be informed that if they are taking clopidogrel (same or in combination with ASA), the haemorrhage may last longer than usual and that they should inform their physician about any unusual bleeding (some occurrence or length).

. For this purpose, the Commission intends to submit the noise committee referred to in Article 13 of the Work Programme, which contains some of the elements below.
. If necessary, the Commission will also consider whether it will give rise to judicial proceedings to supplement active implementation of the activities described below.
. Completion of the Harmonised Mapping Framework Despite improving the comparability of strategic noise mapping, the situation is far from ideal.
. It is apparent from ongoing evaluation that it is still difficult to submit comparable data on the number of persons exposed to excessive noise levels.
. The difficulties are related, inter alia, with different data collection methods, quality and availability of data and evaluation methods used.
. This is the cause of different results in EU Member States.
. The comparability level will ultimately lead a framework for the harmonisation of methods(s) that will sufficiently reflect the sectoral specifications.
. In 2008 the Commission started working on the development of harmonised noise exposure methods (according to Article 6(2)).
. The project entitled ‘CNOSSOS-EU’ (Common noise assessment methods in Europe) leading the Joint Research Centre shall ensure a technical basis for preparing the Commission Implementing Decision.
. In the case that technical work can be completed in 2011, the Commission considers possible revision of Annex II to the noise Directive in rural middle at the beginning of 2012 (after the Committee in 2011 gives an opinion in 2011).
. Harmonised methodological framework could concentrate on strategic mapping and would have to carefully balanced needs in the field of harmonisation of adequacy and sectoral specifics, such as data requirements.
. In this Decision, the Commission intends to propose a joint work programme of the Commission/European Environment Agency/Member States targeting the implementation of the CNOSSOS-EU project for 2012-2015, in order to functionally for the third reporting cycle in 2017.
. The development of implementing EU guidelines The number of aspects of the Directive has not been detailed or leaves room for different interpretation and implementation.
. Many Member States have suggested that these issues are addressed through a specific action to help implement and respect compliance at EU level, e.g. the development of documents with guidance, exchange information on best practices or organising specific workshops and training courses.
. Such action could focus on the following issues: mapping methods and best practice of mapping, forecast values for noise maps, relationships between dose and reaction, calculation of repeated exposure, production of action plans and permissible or target values.
. Commission of the European Communities shall bear its own costs as well as the costs incurred by Anton Pieter Roodhuijzen in the context of this proceeding.

. Article 28 The Charter ensures the right to negotiate collective bargaining.
. This right shall be exercised ‘in accordance with Union law’.

If, consequently, the Court held that the European Union law precludes the application of the ‘immediate work’ principle for the dependent child, a specific provision should not be laid down in a proportionate reduction of that contribution for part-time workers (in the present case Article 22(4) of the collective agreement in the banking sector).

ing the creation of a legal and fiscal environment, which is favourable to businesses In order to use our businesses all the opportunities offered by the Single Market, including freedom of establishment, the rules on which the Single Market is based, simple, adapted and have to match problems encountered by businesses in daily activities.
. The measures proposed in this section are calculated, inter alia, by reducing administrative and regulatory burden, with positive impacts on growth and job creation[17].
ally specific initiatives will be taken to ensure the interconnection of business registers and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union.
. There are also fiscal issues.
. Initiatives in corporate taxation or VAT should limit administrative burdens and facilitate their cross-border activities.
. Furthermore, it deserves particular attention to the defence and security sector as they stimulate development and growth throughout the economy as a result of their top technologies, innovation and know-how.
. 19 : The Commission will take initiatives to improve the coordination of national fiscal policies, in particular by the proposal for a directive to create a common consolidated basis for corporate taxation (CZS) in 2011.
, among the 27 existing national systems of taxation in the EU, there are large differences, creating significant fiscal obstacles for cross-border activities of companies, or even preventing that activity.
. Such fragmentation leads to a significant market disruption and the cost of putting into conformity with the provisions.
. This concerns in particular SMEs, which often meet the necessary means to overcome these deficiencies, and can deter them from developing a single market.
. The introduction of a common consolidated corporate tax base is intended to address the issue of fiscal provisions which limit growth.
ing societies should only be governed by a single set of rules and should act only with one fiscal management throughout the EU (‘the Single Contact Point’).
. Turnover should be consolidated at group level and losses should be deducted from profits regardless of the border.
of double taxation or double exemptions due to differences or incompatibility between national fiscal rules would be excluded in relations within groups.
ally coordinated measures at national level would only reproduce the current situation, since companies would still be confronted with so many fiscal systems, as many states in which they operate.
. 107 In that regard, it must be borne in mind that Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1515/2001 provides that if the dispute resolution authority adopts a report concerning non-contractive measures, the Council may, if deemed appropriate, repeal or amend the contested measures or adopt other appropriate specific measures in order to take account of the legal interpretations in it.
. According to recital 5 of the preamble to that regulation, the EU institutions may consider appropriate to repeal or amend the measures adopted under the basic Regulation, including those not subject to dispute resolution proceedings within the framework of the memorandum to the rules and procedures governing dispute resolution, or adopt other specific measures taking into account the legal interpretation contained in the report adopted by the dispute resolution authority.
. 108 Secondly, as the applicant rightly states, the provisions of EU law must be interpreted as far as possible in the light of international law, in particular if the objective of those provisions is to implement an international agreement concluded by the Community, such as in the case of a basic regulation adopted to meet international obligations arising from the anti-dumping agreement (see recital 3 of the basic Regulation).

. Principle of prudence provides Community legislators in particular wider, but not unlimited discretion.

. The applicant said that new product species appeared on the market, such as reclassified platelets consisting only of wooden sheets, each of which has a thickness of not more than 6 mm, at least with one external layer from wood bintangor, red canarium, cedondong or some other species, not covered by permanent films from other materials.
. These products should be included in the scope of the measures in question, since they have the same physical and chemical characteristics and final uses as a product covered by existing measures.
. Product concerned and new product types should therefore be considered as a single product.

.
. 44 As regards Article 2 of the Decision on the Community, the Commission contests the CMF’s assertion that the Court of First Instance stated that the regulatory procedure can only be used for measures of general scope.
) Findings of the Court 45 Both of the part examined for the ground of appeal and, consequently, that is the very reason for appeal, do not have a separate existence.
. 47 As the Advocate General points out in paragraph 41 of his Opinion, the two parts of the appeal are more specific in the context of the fourth, the third ground of appeal, which is challenged by the Court of First Instance’s own legal analysis.
. 48 That part of the appeal is therefore consistent with the fourth, respective to third ground of appeal.
. 49 Consequently, it is not necessary to examine them individually.
. For the ground of appeal based on the distortion of the facts Arguments of the parties – Arguments of the appellants 50 CMF submits that the Court of First Instance adopted, in paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, in which the facts of the case are reiterated, the Court adopted a totally fictional legal structure of the competent national authorities regarding the existence of indirect invoicing.

. In that regard, it is sufficient that the common component is not negligible.
. 57 It must be noted, however, that the Court of First Instance stated, first, that the overall impression conferred by the mark applied for, dominates the element ‘creacies kennya’, to which the consumer concerned focuses in a wide range of attention and, secondly, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘ck’ element in relation to the element ‘creaciones kennya’ is only an intervener, which essentially concludes that the element ‘ck’ is negligible in the mark applied for.
. 58 By virtue of the correct analysis, the Court ruled out any similarity between the marks in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rightly concluded that, despite the good name of earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.
. 59 The third part of the first plea must therefore be declared unfounded.
. 60 In those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
. The second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By their second ground of appeal, the appellant complains that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, when it did not examine the good name of the earlier marks under that provision.
. 62 The Court of First Instance held that, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, the appellant alleges a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, whereas the action was also expressly based on infringement of Article 8(5) of this Regulation.
. 63 The Court of First Instance erred in law in finding that since the conflicting marks are similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of earlier marks.
. The fact that the earlier trade mark of Calvin Klein is generally known should be taken into account according to the appellant in order to determine whether more extensive protection needs to be granted to it.
. Good name of the earlier mark must be assessed in assessing similarity between the conflicting marks and not after similarity has been demonstrated.
. 64 In that regard, the appellant claims that if the famous CK mark would be protected only if the third parties ‘cK’ would be used in the same way graphic representation, it would mean that the CK trade mark would be granted a level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection that would enjoy if it were not generally known.
. The fact that the trade mark of the CK as well as other different graphic representation of those letters is well known to them against the use of the ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, since this point identifies Calvin Klein Klein, so that their use of a third party causes confusion through association.
. 65 The OHIM claims that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance has rightly ruled on the question of the good name of the earlier mark in the judgment under appeal.
. Since the signs at issue cannot be regarded as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 shall not apply.
. 66 Zafra Marroquineros states that, in the judgment under appeal, reference is made to the good name of earlier marks.

. In accordance with Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receiving them.
. In particular, in cases where such checks cannot be completed before receiving these payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of administrative sanctions should be made in accordance with this Regulation or by starting.
. rules should be laid down on the authorities in the Member States responsible for the control system of cross-compliance obligations.
. minimum control rate should be established for the verification of the obligations relating to conditionality.
. This control rate should be fixed at least 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, which fall within the scope of the competent control authorities and who must be selected on the basis of adequate risk analysis.
. For the purpose of calculating the control sample, the group of persons under Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, flexibility should be granted to Member States in determining whether the group will assess as a whole or any member of the group individually.
. Member States should be able to choose whether to meet the minimum level of checks at each competent control authority, at the level of paying agency or at the level of the act or standards, or the set of acts or standards.
. If specific legislation applicable to acts or standards lays down minimum control rates, Member States should respect these rates.
. However, Member States should be allowed to use a uniform control rate of on-the-spot checks on conditionality.
. If Member States choose this option, all cases of non-compliance detected during the on-the-spot checks under sector legislation should be reported and followed under conditionality.
. To simplify the obligation on conditionality obligations in relation to Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the application of the specific level of sampling from the monitoring plans should be considered as fulfilling the requirement of a minimum rate laid down in this Regulation.
. Member States should be granted flexibility necessary to achieve a minimum control rate by using results from other on-the-spot checks or by replacing beneficiaries.
. In order to avoid weakening of the control system, in particular as regards the selection of samples for on-the-spot checks on conditionality, the following checks carried out in relation to the de minimis rule referred to in Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
ifying a significant degree of non-compliance in relation to conditionality should lead to an increase in the number of on-the-spot checks in order to achieve an acceptable level of security as regards the correctness of the aid applications concerned.
