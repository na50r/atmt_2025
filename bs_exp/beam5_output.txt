. The main objective of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) in the field of active and healthy ageing is to increase the average length of healthy life in the EU by two years by 2020.
orship seeks to improve the quality of life of older citizens and more effective health care solutions.
will focus on the use of innovation in a larger scale than now, in areas such as health promotion, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, integrated health and social care systems based on cooperation, as well as assisting technologies.
. The Commission will analyse the responses to the consultation to obtain a clear view of the potential and capacity of innovation in various areas that have an impact on ageing in today.
. On the basis of these answers, there is a further procedure in the European Innovation Partnership.
. online consultation is also taking place with the European Innovation Conference on active and healthy ageing, held in Brussels today.
. More than 150 stakeholder representatives discuss their views on it how to transform partnerships into specific acts.
. The European Partnership for Innovation in active and healthy ageing is part of the EU's strategy "Union innovation", which is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, which aims to transform ideas in jobs, environmental growth and social progress (IP/10/1288).
. Innovation Union has three objectives: to allow Europe to achieve scientific results at world level, to alter the way of cooperation between public and private sectors, in particular through innovation partnerships, and eliminate obstacles (such as costly patents, market fragmentation, slow introduction of standards and insufficient qualifications) currently preventing rapid penetration of ideas on the market.
. This corresponds to the objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe that is fully exploiting ICT potential and promote prosperity and improve the quality of life (see IP/10/581, MEMO/10/199 and MEMO/10/200).

. Harmonisation of EU intervention Access to food security in developing countries must be based on the principles of the Paris Declaration on the effectiveness of the assistance, Action Programme from Akkkry and the EU Code with regard to the work on development policy.
. The EU and Member States should identify regions and countries in terms of their comparative benefits in relation to which work should be divided and coordinated under the management of a particular major donor.
. EU and Member States have several policy frameworks and financial instruments that can help partner countries deal with food security problems.
uster effectiveness of their measures should help to harmonise policies, more closely linked to instruments and coordination with private investors.
ing policies in favour of development[26] in the field of food security will be developed through a range of political instruments including agriculture, trade, fisheries, fight against climate change, environmental protection and research.
. This coherence has been strengthened by reforming the common agricultural policy and future reforms will take into account global food security objectives.
ating reform of the Common Fisheries Policy will further increase the coherence of European fisheries policies and fisheries methods on the one hand and the development objectives on the other hand.
. Lastly, achieving balanced, comprehensive and ambitious results of the development programme from Doha strengthened the international trading system, which should have a favourable impact on food security.
power the coherence of the EU's international governance system and Member States should better align the way food security is managed in international scale and to support the accelerated reform of the Committee on food security in the world (CFS), which is a central body in that area.
. The reformed committee should strive for supervisory powers in other specific areas that affect food security, such as food aid and nutrition.
ally, the priorities of the three UN agencies established in Rome (FAO, WFP, IFAD) and should also be improved in order to synergies.
. The reform of the UN system and ongoing review of the role and priorities of the FAO are opportunities to increase quality and efficiency.

. The vessels which relate to the limitation of fishing effort Member State shall not authorise fishing gear falling within one of the groups of fishing gear defined in point 3, in the area of no vessel which, in 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005 or 2006, have not demonstrated any fishing activity in this area, with the exclusion of fishing activities resulting from the transfer of days between fishing vessels if they do not ensure that equivalent capacity measured in kilowets must not be hunted in the area.
ing the vessel with a record of the use of equipment belonging to one of the groups of fishing gear defined in point 3, may be authorised to use other gears provided that the number of days allocated to that second device is at least equal to the number of days allocated to the first device.
ating the vessel flying the flag of a Member State which does not have quotas defined in point 1, shall not fish in this area with the use of equipment belonging to one of the groups of fishing gear defined in point 3, provided that quota is not allocated on the basis of the transfer in accordance with Article 20(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 and if the days at sea are not allocated under point 13 of this Annex.

. It is not necessary that the question is raised by the parties themselves; the national court may also refer it without a proposal.
. Request for a preliminary ruling concerning interpretation Each court in question has jurisdiction to refer the Court a question to the interpretation of the rules of Community law, provided that it considers necessary to resolve the dispute submitted to it.
. In contrast, the court whose decisions cannot be challenged by remedies under national law is in principle obliged to submit a question to the Court, unless there is a case-law in the field (and any new framework raises real doubts as to the possibility of applying this case-law) or is the correct way of interpretation of the Community rules completely obvious.
. The Court of First Instance, whose decisions may be challenged by remedies, so may, in particular if the case-law is sufficiently clear on the basis of the case-law of the Court of Justice, to decide on the correct interpretation of Community law and the use of the facts made.
. However, the reference for a preliminary ruling may, in the appropriate stage of the proceedings, show as particularly useful if it is a new issue of interpretation which is a general meaning for the uniform application of Community law in the Union or where the current case-law does not appear to be applicable to a completely new factual framework.
. It is for the national court to explain what the interpretation required is necessary to interpret its judgment is necessary.
. Request for a preliminary ruling concerning the assessment of the validity If the national courts have the opportunity to refuse the plea in law relating to annulment before them, the possibility of declaring the Community act invalid falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
. Each national court must therefore refer to the Court a reference for a preliminary ruling if it has doubts on the validity of the Community act, with a view to establishing the grounds for which the Community act could be affected by invalidity.
. However, if a national court has serious doubts as to the validity of a Community act based on a national act, it may exceptionally suspend temporarily the implementation of that act or in that regard take any other precautionary measure.
. It is then required to ask a question concerning the validity of the Court and to state the reasons why the Community act is not valid.
. When submitting a reference for a preliminary ruling, the national court may submit a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling as soon as it finds that the decision on the question or questions of interpretation or validity is necessary to give judgment to its judgment; it is a national court which may best assess in what stage of the proceedings must be submitted.
. However, it is desirable that the order for a preliminary ruling should be taken in the proceedings where the court is able to define the factual and legal framework of the problem so that the Court should have any evidence necessary, where appropriate, to verify that Community law in the main proceedings is applicable.
can also be shown in the interests of sound administration of justice in order to refer the question referred for a preliminary ruling after the contractor discussion of the case.
. In the form of a reference for a preliminary ruling, the decision which the national court asks for a preliminary ruling may be adopted in any form which national law allows for procedural issues.
. However, it should be noted that this document, which is the basis for the proceedings which takes place before the Court of Justice and that the Court must have a useful answer to the national court.

Notwithstanding whether, under this assumption, the limitation period for APSA would be interrupted in time by bringing an action against APMSD ( 36 ) would have been initiated on 16 October 2002 against APSA in any event before the expiry of the 10-year period if the Ministry of Health referred to before the expiry of 16 October 1992 ( 37 ) .
. Even if it is no longer possible to detect the precise moment of the sale of the medical ministry, and it would only be possible to define it for a period between 22 September 1992 – the date of adoption of the vaccine in APMSD – and on 3 November 1992 – vaccination of the opponent – the initiation of the APSA proceeding on 16 October 2002 in any event of the limitation period should be interrupted in time.
. If APSA would have to show a moment of placing the vaccine into circulation.
. If APSA could only define this moment as a certain period starting for more than ten years before the application, APSA ends less than ten years before its submission, APSA should not only be the burden of proof, but also the proof of the exact moment of the initiation of the limitation period.
, even if it is not intended for a precise moment to be put into circulation, the judicial procedure on 16 October 2002 would be initiated in any event in time and therefore would have the effects of interrupting the limitation period.

ally, as with other antiagreganic agents, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients with potential risk of increased bleeding after trauma, operation or as a result of other pathological conditions and in the case of concomitant administration of clopidogrel and ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or non-steroidal antiflogistics (NSAID) including cox-2 inhibitors or selective serotonin re-treatment inhibitors (SRI).
patients should be closely monitored if they do not have any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or invasive cardiological performance or surgery.
ating clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended because it may increase bleeding intensity (see section 4.5).
. If the patient has a planned operation and antiaggregation effect is not temporarily desirable, clopidogrel should be discontinued within 7 days prior to performance.
. Patients should warn the doctor and dental doctor before planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy that they take clopidogrel.
ally, clopidogrel extends bleeding time and should therefore be administered to patients with tendency to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular) cautiously.
. 4 Patients should be informed that if they are taking clopidogrel (same or in combination with ASA), the haemorrhage may last longer than usual and that they should inform their physician about any unusual bleeding (some occurrence or length).

. In this respect, the Commission intends to submit the noise committee referred to in Article 13 of the Work Programme, which contains some of the elements below.
ally, if necessary, the Commission will also consider whether it will give rise to judicial proceedings to supplement active implementation of the activities described below.
. Completion of the Harmonised Mapping Framework Despite improving the comparability of strategic noise mapping, the situation is far from ideal.
. It is apparent from ongoing evaluation that it is still difficult to submit comparable data on the number of persons exposed to excessive noise levels.
. The difficulties are related, inter alia, with different data collection methods, quality and availability of data and evaluation methods used.
. This is the cause of different results in EU Member States.
. The comparability level will ultimately lead a framework for the harmonisation of methods(s) that will sufficiently reflect the sectoral specifications.
. In 2008 the Commission started working on the development of harmonised noise exposure methods (according to Article 6(2)).
. The project entitled ‘CNOSSOS-EU’ (Common noise assessment methods in Europe) leading the Joint Research Centre shall ensure a technical basis for preparing the Commission Implementing Decision.
. In the case that technical work can be completed in 2011, the Commission considers possible revision of Annex II to the noise Directive in the rural middle of 2012 (after the Committee in 2011 gives an opinion in 2011).
. Harmonised methodological framework could concentrate on strategic mapping and should carefully balance the needs of harmonisation of adequacy and sectoral specifics, such as data requirements.
. In this Decision, the Commission intends to propose a joint work programme of the Commission/European Environment Agency/Member States targeting the implementation of the CNOSSOS-EU project for 2012-2015, in order to functionally for the third reporting cycle in 2017.
. The development of implementing EU guidelines The number of aspects of the Directive has not been detailed or leaves room for different interpretation and implementation.
. Many Member States have proposed that these issues are addressed through a specific action that will help implement and compliance with EU level, e.g. the development of documents with guidance, exchange information on best practices or organising specific workshops and training courses.
. Such action could focus on the following issues: mapping methods and best practice of mapping, forecast values for noise maps, relationships between dose and reaction, calculation of repeated exposure, production of action plans and permissible or target values.
. The Commission of the European Communities shall bear its own costs as well as the costs incurred by Anton Pieter Roodhuijzen in the context of this proceeding.

. 42 By failing to state Article 2 of the Decision on the compatibility which provides for non-compulsory criteria for the choice of procedural conditions to be followed by the appellant in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance wrongly stated that the regulatory procedure can only be used for measures of general scope.
. – Arguments of the Commission 43 The Commission considers that the reference to the 30th recital in the preamble to Regulation No 3319/94 is not relevant for the purposes of interpreting Article 1(3) of the second subparagraph of this Regulation imposing a specific duty where two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of indirect invoicing and imports of ZAP.
. 44 As regards Article 2 of the Decision on the Community, the Commission contests the CMF’s assertion that the Court of First Instance stated that the regulatory procedure can only be used for measures of general scope.
) Findings of the Court 45 Both of the part examined for the ground of appeal and, consequently, that is the very reason for appeal, do not have a separate existence.
. 47 As the Advocate General points out in paragraph 41 of his Opinion, the two parts of the appeal are more specific to the fourth, the third ground of appeal, which is challenged by the Court of First Instance’s own legal analysis.
. 48 That part of the appeal is therefore consistent with the fourth, respective to third ground of appeal.
. 49 Consequently, it is not necessary to examine them individually.
. For the ground of appeal based on the distortion of the facts Arguments of the parties – Arguments of the appellants 50 CMF submits that the Court of First Instance adopted, in paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, in which the facts of the case are reiterated, the Court adopted a totally fictional legal structure of the competent national authorities regarding the existence of indirect invoicing.
. 51 That performance is incomplete and incorrect and thus leads to distortion of facts.

. In that regard, it is sufficient that the common component is not negligible.
. 57 However, it must be noted that the Court of First Instance stated, first, that the overall impression which triggered the mark applied for, dominates the element ‘creacies kennya’, to which the consumer concerned focuses in a wide range of attention and, secondly, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘ck’ element in relation to the element ‘creaciones kennya’ is only an intervener, which essentially concludes that the element ‘ck’ is negligible in the mark applied for.
. 58 The Court of First Instance, which, on the basis of the correct analysis, ruled out any similarity between the conflicting marks and in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, rightly concluded that despite the good name of the earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.
. 59 The third part of the first plea must therefore be declared unfounded.
. 60 In those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
. The second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By their second ground of appeal, the appellant complains that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, when it did not examine the good name of the earlier marks under that provision.
. 62 The Court of First Instance held that, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, that the appellant alleges a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, whereas the action was also expressly based on infringement of Article 8(5) of this Regulation.
. 63 The Court of First Instance erred in law in finding that since the conflicting marks are similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of earlier marks.
. The fact that the earlier mark of CK Calvin Klein is generally known should be taken into account according to the appellant in order to determine whether more extensive protection needs to be granted to it.
. Good name of the earlier mark must be assessed in assessing similarity between the conflicting marks and not after similarity has been demonstrated.
. 64 In that regard, the appellant claims that if the famous CK mark would be protected only if the third parties ‘cK’ would be used in the same way by the graphic representation, it would mean that the trade mark of the CK with good name would be granted a level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection enjoyed if it were not generally known.
. The fact that the trade mark of the CK as well as other different graphic representation of those letters is well known to them against the use of the ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, since this point identifies Calvin Klein Klein, so that their use of a third party causes confusion through association.
. 65 The OHIM claims that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance has rightly ruled on the question of the good name of the earlier mark in the judgment under appeal.
. Since the signs at issue cannot be regarded as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 shall not apply.

. In accordance with Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receiving them.
. In particular, in cases where such checks cannot be completed before receiving these payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of administrative sanctions should be made in accordance with this Regulation or by starting.
. rules should be laid down on the authorities in the Member States responsible for the control system of obligations on conditionality.
. minimum control rate should be established for the verification of the obligations relating to conditionality.
. This control rate should be fixed at at least 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, which fall within the scope of the competent control authorities and which must be selected on the basis of adequate risk analysis.
. For the purpose of calculating the control sample, the group of persons under Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, flexibility should be granted to Member States in determining whether the group will assess as a whole or any member of the group individually.
. Member States should be able to choose whether to meet the minimum level of checks at each competent control authority, at the level of paying agency or at the level of the act or standards, or the set of acts or standards.
. If specific legislation applicable to acts or standards lays down minimum control rates, Member States should respect these rates.
. However, Member States should be allowed to use a uniform control rate for the on-the-spot checks on conditionality.
. If Member States choose this option, all cases of non-compliance detected during the on-the-spot checks under sector legislation should be reported and followed under conditionality.
. To simplify the obligation on conditionality obligations in relation to Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the application of the specific level of sampling from the monitoring plans should be considered as fulfilling the requirement of a minimum rate laid down in this Regulation.
. Member States should be granted flexibility necessary to achieve a minimum control rate by using results from other on-the-spot checks or by replacing beneficiaries.
. In order to avoid weakening of the control system, in particular as regards the selection of samples for on-the-spot checks on conditionality, the following checks carried out in relation to the de minimis rule referred to in Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
. Detecting a significant degree of non-compliance with conditionality should lead to an increase in the number of on-the-spot checks in order to achieve an acceptable level of certainty as regards the correctness of the aid applications concerned.
