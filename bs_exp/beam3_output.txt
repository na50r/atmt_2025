However, the reference for a preliminary ruling may, in the appropriate stage of the proceedings, show as particularly useful if it is a new issue of interpretation which is a general meaning for the uniform application of Community law in the Union or where the current case-law does not appear to be applicable to a completely new factual framework.
. The national court is responsible for explaining what the interpretation required is necessary in order to interpret its judgment.
. Request for a preliminary ruling concerning the assessment of the validity If the national courts have the possibility of refusing to refuse the grounds relating to annulment before them, the possibility of declaring the Community act invalid falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
. Each national court must therefore refer to the Court a reference for a preliminary ruling if it has doubts on the validity of the Community act, with a view to which the Community act might be liable to have an invalidity.
. However, if a national court has serious doubts as to the validity of a Community act based on a national act, it may exceptionally suspend temporarily the implementation of that act or in that regard take any other precautionary measure.
. It is then required to ask a question concerning the validity of the Court and to state the reasons why the Community act is not valid.
. When submitting a reference for a preliminary ruling, the national court may submit a reference for a preliminary ruling on the question referred, as soon as it finds that the decision on the question or questions of interpretation or validity is necessary to give judgment to him; it is a national court which may best assess in what stage of the proceedings must be submitted.
. However, it is desirable that the order for a preliminary ruling should be taken in the proceedings where the court is able to define the factual and legal framework of the problem so that the Court should have any evidence necessary, where appropriate, to verify that Community law in the main proceedings is applicable.
can also be shown in the interests of good administration of justice in order to refer the question referred for a preliminary ruling after the contradictory discussion of the case.
. In the form of a reference for a preliminary ruling, the decision which the national court asks for a preliminary ruling may be adopted in any form which national law allows for procedural issues.
. However, it should be noted that this document, which is the basis for the proceedings which will take place before the Court of Justice and that the Court must have knowledge available to it which allows it to provide a useful answer to the national court.

. These two articles provide that, in respect of failure to comply with the rules under the CRP, specific rules for the ERDF may lay down specific grounds for interrupting and suspending payments.
. In order to protect the financial interests of the Union and its taxpayers, where the Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the CRP, or if the Commission has evidence indicating such failure, the Commission has the opportunity to suspend payment periods under Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.

. Cases of non-compliance with the rules of the CRP, which are essential to maintain biological marine resources, should be considered serious if the Member State has not taken the necessary measures to remedy the situation resulting in the suspension of the payment period.
. Before interrupting or suspending payments, the Commission must adopt implementing acts pursuant to Article 100(2) and 101(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, which further clarifies the failure to fulfil obligations under the CRP of a Member State which may affect expenditure for which an interim payment is sought.

. If the ten-year limitation period should start running until the transfer of APSA vaccine to the Ministry of Health, the precise moment of the sale of APMSD to the Ministry of Health should be determined to determine the date of the start of the limitation period.
. Notwithstanding whether, under this assumption, the limitation period for APSA would be interrupted in time by bringing an action against APMSD, ( 36 ) it would have been initiated on 16 October 2002 against the APSA in any event before the expiry of the 10-year period if the Ministry of Health referred to before the expiry of 16 October 1992).
. Even if it is no longer possible to detect the precise moment of the sale of the medical ministry, and it would only be possible to define it for a period between 22 September 1992 – the date of adoption of the vaccine in APMSD – and on 3 November 1992 – vaccination of the opponent – the initiation of the APSA proceeding on 16 October 2002 in any event of the limitation period should be interrupted in time.
. If APSA would have to show a moment of placing the vaccine into circulation.
. If APSA could only define this moment as a certain period starting for more than ten years before the application, APSA ends less than ten years before its submission, APSA should not only be the burden of proof, but also the proof of the exact moment of the initiation of the limitation period.
, even if it is not intended for a precise moment to be put into circulation, the judicial procedure on 16 October 2002 would be initiated in any event in time and therefore would have the effects of interrupting the limitation period.

. Maglore learned so many new and at the same time understood Zindevar's impatience, secretaryism, and why she'd protected the mind from visitors.

. In this respect, the Commission intends to submit the noise committee referred to in Article 13 of the Work Programme, which contains some of the elements below.
. If necessary, the Commission will also consider whether it will give rise to judicial proceedings to supplement active implementation of the activities described below.
. Completion of the Harmonised Mapping Framework Despite improving the comparability of strategic noise mapping, the situation is far from ideal.
ing evaluation is apparent from the ongoing assessment that it is still difficult to submit comparable data on the number of persons exposed to excessive noise levels.
. The difficulties are related, inter alia, with different data collection methods, quality and availability of data and evaluation methods used.
. This is the cause of different results in EU Member States.
. The comparability level will ultimately lead a framework for the harmonisation of methods(s) that will sufficiently reflect the sectoral specifications.
. In 2008 the Commission started working on the development of harmonised noise exposure methods (according to Article 6(2)).
. The project entitled ‘CNOSSOS-EU’ (Common noise assessment methods in Europe) leading the Joint Research Centre shall ensure a technical basis for preparing the Commission Implementing Decision.
. If technical work can be completed in 2011, the Commission considers possible revision of Annex II to the noise Directive in the rural middle of 2012 (after the Committee in 2011 gives an opinion in 2011).
. Harmonised methodological framework could concentrate on strategic mapping and should carefully balance the needs of harmonisation of adequacy and sectoral specifics, such as data requirements.
. In this Decision, the Commission intends to propose a joint work programme of the Commission/European Environment Agency/Member States targeting the implementation of the CNOSSOS-EU project for 2012-2015, in order to functionally for the third reporting cycle in 2017.
. The development of implementing EU guidelines The number of aspects of the Directive has not been detailed or leaves room for different interpretation and implementation.
. Many Member States have proposed that these issues are addressed through a specific action that will help implement and compliance with EU level, e.g. the development of documents with guidance, exchange information on best practices or organising specific workshops and training courses.
. Such action could focus on the following issues: mapping methods and best practice of mapping, forecast values for noise maps, relationships between dose and reaction, calculation of repeated exposure, the creation of action plans and permissible or target values.
. The Commission of the European Communities shall bear its own costs as well as the costs incurred by Anton Pieter Roodhuijzen in the context of this proceeding.

. 42 By failing to state Article 2 of the Decision on the compatibility which establishes non-conceptional criteria for the choice of procedural conditions to be complied with under the appellant in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal, it was wrong to state that the regulatory procedure can only be used for measures of general scope.
. – Arguments of the Commission 43 The Commission considers that the reference to the 30th recital in the preamble to Regulation No 3319/94 is not relevant for the purposes of interpreting Article 1(3) of the second subparagraph of this Regulation, which imposes a specific duty where two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of indirect invoicing and imports of ZAP.
. 44 As regards Article 2 of the Decision on the Comitology, the Commission contests the CMF’s assertion that the Court of First Instance stated that the regulatory procedure can only be used for measures of general scope.
. The Court’s conclusions 45 By the two part examined ground of appeal and, therefore, the very plea in law itself, do not have a separate existence.
. 47 As the Advocate General points out in paragraph 41 of his Opinion, the two parts of the appeal are more specific to the fourth, the third ground of appeal, which is challenged by the Court of First Instance’s own legal analysis.
. 48 That part of the appeal is therefore consistent with the fourth, respective to third ground of appeal.
. 49 Consequently, it is not necessary to examine them individually.
. For the ground of appeal based on the distortion of the facts Arguments of the parties – Arguments of the appellants 50 CMF submits that the Court of First Instance in paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, in which the facts of the case are reiterated, adopted a totally fictional legal structure of the competent national authorities regarding the existence of indirect invoicing.
. 51 That performance is incomplete and incorrect and thus leads to distortion of facts.

. In that regard, it is sufficient that the common component is not negligible.
. 57 However, it must be noted that the Court of First Instance stated, first, that the overall impression which triggered the mark applied for, dominates the element ‘creacies kennya’, to which the consumer concerned focuses his attention in a broad extent and, secondly, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘ck’ element in relation to the element ‘creaciones kennya’ is only an intervener, which essentially concludes that the element ‘ck’ is negligible in the mark applied for.
. 58 By virtue of the correct analysis, the Court of First Instance ruled out any similarity between the conflicting marks and in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, it was right to conclude that despite the good name of the earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.
. 59 The third part of the first plea must therefore be declared unfounded.
. 60 In those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
. The second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By their second ground of appeal, the appellant complains that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, when it did not examine the good name of the earlier marks under that provision.
. 62 The Court of First Instance held that, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, that the appellant alleges a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, whereas the action was also expressly based on infringement of Article 8(5) of this Regulation.
. 63 The Court of First Instance erred in law in finding that since the conflicting marks are similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of earlier marks.
. The fact that the earlier mark of CK Calvin Klein is generally known is to be taken into account in the appellant for determining whether more extensive protection should be granted to it.
. Good name of the earlier mark must be assessed in the assessment of similarity between the conflicting marks and not after similarity has been demonstrated.
. 64 In that regard, the appellant claims that if the famous CK mark would be protected only if the third parties ‘cK’ would be used in the same way by the graphic representation, it would mean that the CK trade mark would be granted a level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection that would have had not been generally known.
. The fact that the trade mark of the CK as well as other different graphic representation of those letters is well known to them against the use of ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, since this sector identifies Calvin Klein Klein, so that their use of a third party is confusing confusion through association.
. 65 OHIM claims that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance has rightly ruled on the question of the good name of the earlier mark in the judgment under appeal.
. Since the signs at issue cannot be regarded as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 shall not apply.
. 66 Zafra Marroquineros states that, in the judgment under appeal, a reference to the good name of the earlier marks is made.

. However, there was no evidence that it would prove that, on the basis of that contract, he actually worked.
. 22 By decision of 21 January 2009, Mahanmuuttovirasto rejected Mr O.’s request for a residence permit submitted to him, with a statement of reasons that Mr O. does not have sufficient revenue.
. Moreover, in the present case, it was considered that there was no reason to depart from the conditions relating to animal resources, as enabled by Article 39(1) of the Law on foreigners in the event of particularly serious circumstances or if the best interests of the child are required.

) checks may be completed before payment and annual premiums pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receiving them.
. In particular, where such checks cannot be completed before the receipt of these payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of administrative sanctions should be made in accordance with this Regulation or by starting.
. rules should be laid down on the authorities in the Member States responsible for the control system of cross-compliance obligations.
. minimum control rate should be established for the verification of the obligations relating to conditionality.
. This control rate should be fixed at least 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, which fall within the scope of the competent control authorities and who must be selected on the basis of adequate risk analysis.
. For the purpose of calculating the control sample, the group of persons under Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, flexibility should be granted to Member States in determining whether the group will assess as a whole or any member of the group individually.
. Member States should be able to choose whether to meet the minimum level of control at each competent control authority, at the level of paying agency or at the level of the act or standards, or the set of acts or standards.
. If specific legislation applicable to acts or standards lays down minimum control rates, Member States should comply with these rates.
. However, Member States should be allowed to use a uniform control rate for the on-the-spot checks on conditionality.
. If Member States choose this option, all cases of non-compliance detected during the on-the-spot checks under sector legislation should be reported and followed under conditionality.
. To simplify the obligation on conditionality obligations in relation to Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the application of the specific level of sampling from the monitoring plans should be considered as fulfilling the requirement of a minimum rate laid down in this Regulation.
. Member States should be granted flexibility necessary to achieve a minimum control rate by using results from other on-the-spot checks or by replacing beneficiaries.
. In order to avoid weakening of the control system, in particular as regards the selection of sampling on the spot on conditionality, the minimum control sample should not be taken into account when calculating the minimum control sample relating to the conditionality of the subsequent control carried out in relation to the de minimis rule referred to in Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
. Detecting a significant degree of non-compliance in the context of conditionality should lead to an increase in the number of on-the-spot checks in order to achieve an acceptable level of certainty as regards the correctness of the aid applications concerned.

. GDP deficit ratio decreased from 5.5% in 2011 to 2,1 % in 2013 and according to the Commission's 2014 economic forecast, the ratio of the government deficit has remained at 2.1% in 2014 at 2.1%.
. Total public debt at the end of 2013 was 39.4% of GDP – this is significantly less than the Maastricht limits.
