Member States shall furnish data for every second year, after the first reference year, for the facilities which are referred to in Section 8(2).
SECTION 6 TRANSMISSION OF RESULTS TO EUROSTAT The results are to be transmitted within 18 months of the end of the reference year.
ESMA should assume responsibility for the registration, withdrawal of registration and supervision of trade repositories.
Given that regulators, CCPs and other market participants rely on the data maintained by trade repositories, it is necessary to ensure that those trade repositories are subject to strict operational, record-keeping and data-management requirements.
Transparency of prices, fees and risk-management models associated with the services provided by CCPs, their members and trade repositories is necessary to enable market participants to make an informed choice.
In order to carry out its duties effectively, ESMA should be able to require, by simple request or by decision, all necessary information from trade repositories, related third parties and third parties to which the trade repositories have outsourced operational functions or activities.
If ESMA requires such information by simple request, the addressee is not obliged to provide the information but, in the event that it does so voluntarily, the information provided should not be incorrect or misleading.
Such information should be made available without delay.
Without prejudice to cases covered by criminal or tax law, the competent authorities, ESMA, bodies or natural or legal persons other than the competent authorities, which receive confidential information should use it only in the performance of their duties and for the exercise of their functions.
However, this should not prevent the exercise, in accordance with national law, of the functions of national bodies responsible for the prevention, investigation or correction of cases of maladministration.
In order to exercise its supervisory powers effectively, ESMA should be able to conduct investigations and on-site inspections.
ESMA should be able to delegate specific supervisory tasks to the competent authority of a Member State, for instance where a supervisory task requires knowledge and experience with respect to local conditions, which are more easily available at national level.
ESMA should be able to delegate the carrying out of specific investigatory tasks and on-site inspections.
Prior to the delegation of tasks, ESMA should consult the relevant competent authority about the detailed conditions relating to such delegation of tasks, including the scope of the task to be delegated, the timetable for the performance of the task, and the transmission of necessary information by and to ESMA.
ESMA should compensate the competent authorities for carrying out a delegated task in accordance with a regulation on fees to be adopted by the Commission by means of a delegated act.
ESMA should not be able to delegate the power to adopt decisions on registration.
It is necessary to ensure that competent authorities are able to request that ESMA examine whether the conditions for the withdrawal of a trade repository’s registration are met.

It was a lot easier and faster than shipping gold bricks, but, for all the convenience, the system that determined a persons or a nation's wealth was no less rigid, and at cer­tain central banks of the world, a country's net collection of those mon­etary units was calculated down to a fraction of a percentage point.
There was some leeway built into the system, to account for trades in process and so forth, hut that leeway was also closely calculated elec­tronically.
What resulted was no different in its effect from the num­bering of the bricks of King Croesus of Lydia.
In fact, if anything, the new system that depended on the movement of electrons or photons from one computer to another was even more exact, and even less for­giving.
Once upon a time, one could paint lead bricks yellow and so fool a casual inspector, but lying to a computerized accounting system re­quired a lot more than that.
In China, the lying was handled by the Ministry of Finance, a bas­tard orphan child in a Marxist country peopled by bureaucrats who struggled on a daily basis to do all manner of impossible things.
The first and easiest impossibility—because it had to be done—was for its senior members to cast aside everything they'd learned in their universities and Communist Party meetings.
To operate in the world financial system, they had to understand and play by—and within—the world monetary rules, instead of the Holy Writ of Karl Marx.
The Ministry of Finance, therefore, was placed in the unenviable position of having to explain to the communist clergy that their god was a false one, that their perfect theoretical model just didn't play in the real world, and that therefore they had to bend to a reality which they had rejected.
The bureaucrats in the ministry were for the most part ob­servers, rather like children playing a computer game that they didn't be­lieve in but enjoyed anyway.
Some of the bureaucrats were actually quite clever, and played the game well, sometimes even making a profit on their trades and transactions.
Those who did so won promotions and status within the ministry.
Some even drove their own automobiles to work and were befriended by the new class of local industrialists who had shed their ideological straitjackets and operated as capitalists within a communist society.
That brought wealth into their nation, and earned the tepid gratitude, if not the respect, of their political masters, rather as a good sheepdog might.
This crop of industrialists worked closely with the Ministry of Finance, and along the way influenced the bu­reaucracy that managed the income that they brought into their coun­try.

Both Directives fall within the field of environment – corresponding to negotiation chapter 27.
This proposal is part of a series of proposals for Council directives by the Commission to the Council which regroup the technical adaptations to Council directives as well as to European Parliament and Council directives corresponding to negotiation chapters into separate proposals for different Council directives.
This structure is designed to facilitate the transposition of the directives concerned by Member States into their respective legal orders.
The package of proposals for legal acts which the Commission has transmitted to the Council is composed of this series of proposals for Council directives on the one hand, as well as of a proposal for a single Council regulation which covers the relevant European Parliament and Council regulations and decisions as well as the relevant Council regulations and decisions on the other hand.
It is foreseen that all the legal acts included in this package will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union at the same date.
The present proposal and the other proposals included in this package will take into account technical adaptations to the acquis which were published in the Official Journal of the European Union until 1 September 2012.
The reasons for this are to provide sufficient time for the legislative processes involved on the one hand, and for the fulfilment of the ensuing transposition and notification obligations by Member States as regards directives on the other hand.
Adaptations which may be necessary to the acquis published in the Official Journal of the European Union after 1 September 2012 will be foreseen in the relevant acts themselves or done at a later stage through the appropriate procedure.
In addition, the Commission intends to informally provide a list of such legislation to Member States in early July 2013.

Chadi Amin A Radi lost his home in the Nahr el Bared camp when it was destroyed in clashes between the Lebanese army and the Islamic Fatah.
His family home and business were also lost.
As there was no room in the nearby Baddawi camp, he, his parents and his siblings stayed with an acquaintance in Tripoli.
However, Lebanese soldiers insulted and mistreated them, arrested them arbitrarily, tortured and humiliated them.
Considering that, as Palestinians, they had no rights, Mr A Radi left Lebanon with his father.
Again, the BAH has not recognised him as a refugee, but has made a non-refoulement order.

"Yes," he said, because he didn't know what else to say.
He put his left hand on her shoulder, felt her strength and her warmth and the easy smoothness of her skin.
His other hand came up to her shoulders, and she kissed him.
He hoped that she liked it as much as he did.
It was a soft, warm and breathless kiss.
When she leaned against him her breasts flattened on his chest and he could feel the hard little knots of nipples focused there.
He felt himself hardening against her thigh, her thigh of such strength and grace.
She stroked his shoulders, then tightened both arms around his neck and kissed him hard, her small tongue tapping the tip of his own.
The boat took a sudden lurch and they both fell in a heap on the deck, laughing.
"How graceful," he said.
"And cold."
She was right.
The suns had set as Twisp and Bushka departed.
Already there was a stiff chill in the air.

A slight increase in greenhouse gas emissions was observed in 2010, during the temporary recovery.
This performance is all the more significant as the European economy has grown by around 45% in real terms since 1990 and it shows a clear decoupling of economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions.
As a result, in 2012 the European economy was almost twice less carbon-intensive – carbon intensity refers to the amount of emissions released per unit of GDP – than in 1990.
Based on the latest trends, the Europe 2020 target related to greenhouse gas emissions seems within reach.
In line with the encouraging developments of recent years, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could exceed the target and reach 24% by 2020.
Greenhouse gas emissions in 2000, 2012 and 2020
(index 1990=100)
Reading: if the climate and energy 2020 package is fully implemented, the EU could reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 24% by 2020, compared to 1990 levels.

Combining funds The question of cumulation of Community funding of various financing sources on the same project has been a constant preoccupation of the Commission.
The Court of Auditors has highlighted this issue in its reports on the Commission's implementation of the trans-European networks.
The Steering Group has concluded that there must be no possibility of cumulation of subsidies from several Community funds.
In order to ensure budgetary transparency and proper financial management, the Financial Regulation and/or basic sectoral acts adopted or in the course of adoption rule out the cumulation of different Community financial instruments for one and the same action.
In the context of operational programmes receiving financial assistance from the Structural Funds and/or the Cohesion Fund, other Community funds cannot provide a substitute for the required national co-funding.
Expenditure within a project that is part of an operational programme receiving financial assistance from the Structural Funds and/or the Cohesion Fund cannot benefit from other Community funding.
The actual construction of the railway line could be funded by the ERDF or the Cohesion Fund.
Projects could also be divided into geographical sections, which could be co-financed either by ERFD/Cohesion Fund or TEN-funding.
When granting TEN-subsidies, the Commission will therefore check whether the projects have not received funding from the Structural Funds or the Cohesion Fund.
After consultation of the Court of Auditors, the Commission will also issue guidelines to Member States on how the different funding instruments can be combined.
Such prohibition of duplicate financing will need to be designed to make Member States choose which financial instrument they will call upon for Community financial support in accordance with the rate of assistance offered by the instrument and the prioritisation of the projects in question.

I was in Buffalo when they hit Pearl Harbour, and all I could think was now it's our fight too.
You've always wanted me in this war Gladys.
That was before I knew what war was!
You said yourself, you can do more on the home front.
We're all fighting hard...
They want to come at us, I'm gonna come right back at them.
James I'm not looking for a hero.
When this war is over, could you love me if I was the one man out there who never fought ?
It wasn't suppose to be like this.

I walked east and counted the stores.
There were seven of them to the corner, all shining with plate glass and chromium trim.
On the corner was a dress shop with mannequins in the windows, scarves and gloves and costume jewelry laid out under the lights.
I rounded the corner and went south.
Heavy eucalyptus trees grew out of the sidewalk.
They branched low down and the trunks looked hard and heavy, quite unlike the tall brittle stuff that grows around Los Angeles.
At the far corner of Polton's Lane there was an automobile agency.
I followed its high blank wall, looking at broken crates, piles of cartons, trash drums, dusty parking spaces, the back yard of elegance.
I counted the buildings.
It was easy.
No questions to ask.
A light burned in the small window of a tiny frame cottage that had long ago been somebody's simple home.
The cottage had a wooden porch with a broken railing.
Once it may even have had a garden.

Wow, it's cool, man.

Your mother told me that you are undercover.
Yes, are you undercover right now?
Yes, this is undercover mission.
Are those bad guys out there?
Oh, my God. This so exciting.
I have gotta call Aunt Anna, she's gonna die.
I heard that Jacob boy, is your partner?
Shut your fucking mouth.
The fact that public policies vary according to the country or time in question does not negate the relevance of price, since it is not disputed that greater therapeutic efficacy relative to existing products is invariably a relevant factor in negotiations.
It adds that the fact that the price of Losec was much more sensitive to the market entry of medicines based on similar or identical molecules than it was to inferior drugs such as H2 blockers, far from being due to the arbitrary exercise of regulatory power, corroborates that view.
134 The Commission disputes the EFPIA’s assertion that manufacturers are not free to set the prices of their products and states that, of the countries taken into account, the United Kingdom uses free pricing, Belgium sets only maximum prices and five States apply reference price systems under which pharmaceutical firms are free to price above the reimbursement level.
The Commission submits, moreover, that the fact that prices agreed with buying organisations were above the competitive level is supported by the fact that the price of Losec and other PPIs dropped significantly after the entry of generic omeprazole in Germany in 1999.
135 The Commission adds that although there is agreement that price does not greatly influence doctors’ prescribing patterns, since doctors are primarily guided by therapeutic considerations, price greatly influences the revenues derived from consumption.
Consequently, the constraints on the commercial behaviour of a producer of PPIs must be evaluated not only by reference to the question whether H2 blockers constrained sales, but also by reference to the question whether H2 blockers constrained prices.
136 As regards the applicant’s argument to the effect that the overall cost of treatment with PPIs is lower due to the fact that the treatment is shorter, the Commission submits that this argument derives from a ‘simplistic quantification’ of the relative cost-effectiveness of PPIs and H2 blockers.
It states, in that regard, that this argument takes into account only a single parameter, namely healing time, and does so in respect of only one of the conditions for which Losec was authorised, namely peptic ulcer.
In addition, this argument leaves out of account the fact that PPIs are significantly superior to H2 blockers in terms of healing rates, symptom relief and prevention of relapse, and that PPIs and H2 blockers were considered to occupy different positions in the hierarchy of treatments.
