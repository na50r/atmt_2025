the main objective of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) in the field of active and healthy ageing is to increase by 2020 the average level of healthy life in the EU for two years.
partnerships to improve the quality of life of older citizens and to more effective health care solutions.
the use of innovation in a larger scale than it is now, in areas such as health promotion, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, integrated health and social care systems based on cooperation and assisting technologies.
the Commission will carry out a discussion of the consultation response to the consultation to obtain a clear view of the potential and capacity of innovation in various areas that have an impact on ageing at today.
, on the basis of these answers, further action is planned in the European Innovation Partnership.
consultation is also taking place with the European Innovation Partnership conference on active and healthy ageing, which is currently held in Brussels today.
more than 150 representatives of stakeholders discuss their views on it how to transform partnerships into specific actions.
the European Innovation Partnership's Independence in the field of active and healthy ageing is part of the EU's "Innovation" strategy, which is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, which aims to transform ideas in jobs, environmental growth and social progress (IP/10/1288).
the Union has a three-way objective: enabling Europe to achieve scientific results at world level, to substantially change the way of cooperation between the public and private sector, especially thanks to innovation partnerships and to remove barriers (such as cost patents, market fragmentation, slow deployment of standards and insufficient qualifications) which currently prevent rapid penetration of ideas on the market.

initiatives aimed at regional cooperation in the field of nutrition should be strengthened with regard to Asia.
the EU's harmonisation of EU intervention Access to food security in developing countries must be based on the principles of the Paris Declaration on the effectiveness of the assistance, the Action Programme of the Akra and the EU rules Code as regards the workshops in the field of development policy.
the EU and Member States should determine the regions and countries in relation to which they should divide work and coordinate their activities under the direction of the specific main donor.
EU and Member States have several political frameworks and financial instruments that can help partner countries to tackle food security problems.
greater effectiveness of their measures should help to promote greater harmonisation of policies, more tight links to instruments and coordination with private investors.
cooperation in favour of development[26] on food security will be developed through a range of policy instruments including agriculture, trade, fishing, tackling climate change, environmental protection and research.
the cohesion has been strengthened by reforming the common agricultural policy and future reforms will be taken into account to global food security objectives.
the future reform of the Common Fisheries Policy will further increase the coherence of European fisheries policies and fisheries methods, on the one hand, and the development objectives of the other part.
, in the last few years, achievements of balanced, comprehensive and ambitious results of the development programme from Doha, has reinforced an international trading system, which should have a positive impact on food security.
improving the coherence of the EU's international management system and Member States should better reconcile the way food security is managed internationally and to promote the accelerated reform of the Food Safety Committee in the world (CFS) which is a central body in that area.
ised Committee should seek the power of supervision in other specific areas affecting food security, e.g. food aid and nutrition.
actions should also be further rationalised by the priorities of the three UN agencies established in Rome (FAO, WFP, IFAD) and should be improved in order to synergies.
actions and the ongoing review of the role and priorities of the FAO are opportunities for increasing quality and efficiency.

, the question is not necessary to raise the parties themselves; the national court may also ask it without a proposal.
reference for a preliminary ruling concerning the interpretation Each court concerned has jurisdiction to refer to the Court of Justice a question relating to the interpretation of Community law, if it considers it necessary to resolve the dispute before it.
, contrary to the court whose decision cannot be challenged by remedies under national law, is in principle obliged to present a question to the Court of Justice, unless there is a case-law (and any new framework does not establish real doubts as to the possibility of applying this case-law) or is the right way of interpretation of Community rules completely obvious.
, the Court of First Instance, whose decision may be challenged by remedies, in particular where the case-law of the Court of Justice is sufficiently clarified, may decide on the right interpretation of Community law and its use on it by the facts.
requests for a preliminary ruling may nevertheless be shown in the appropriate stage of the procedure as particularly useful in so far as a new question of interpretation of the general meaning for the uniform application of Community law in the Union or if the current case-law does not appear to be applicable to a completely new factual framework.
the national court is for the national court to explain what the required interpretation necessary for the resolution of its judgment is required.
requests for a preliminary ruling concerning an assessment of validity Where national courts have the possibility of refusing pleas concerning invalidity which are applied before them, the possibility of declaring the Community act invalid falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
, each national court must therefore ask the Court for a preliminary ruling if it has doubts as to the validity of the Community measure, indicating the reasons for which it considers that the Community act could be affected by invalidity.
, however, if the national court has serious doubts as to the validity of the Community measure on which national act is based, it may exceptionally suspend temporarily the implementation of the latter act or in that regard to any other precautionary measure.
, it is required to ask the question whether the Court is valid and to state reasons why it considers that the Community act is not valid.
, at the time of the application for a preliminary ruling The national court may submit a reference for a preliminary ruling after it finds that the decision on the question or questions of interpretation or validity is necessary to enable it to be delivered by its judgment; it is a national court which can best be assessed in what stage the procedure is such a request.
, however, it is desirable that the decision to refer a preliminary ruling is adopted at the stage of the proceedings, where the court hearing is able to define the factual and legal context of the problem, in order to enable the Court to have all the information necessary to verify that the Community law of the dispute in the main proceedings is applicable.
, it may also be demonstrated in the interests of sound administration of justice, in order to provide a preliminary question referred after the contradictory discussion of the case.
, in the form of a reference for a preliminary ruling from the decision of the decision which the national court considers a preliminary question to the Court, it may be accepted in any form permitting national law for the case of procedural issues.
, however, it must be held that this document, which is the basis for the proceedings which takes place before the Court of Justice and that the Court must have the information available to it to enable the national court to provide a useful answer to the national court.

, pursuant to Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) , financial assistance from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (ENRF) is conditional on compliance with the rules of the SRP by the Member States.
: failure to comply with the rules of the SRP Member States may result in interruptions or suspension of payments or financial correction of Union financial assistance granted under the CRP.
requirements for the suspension of payment periods may be established in Article 83(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) are fixed in respect of which the suspension of payments may be imposed and in Article 142(1) of that regulation.
of these two articles provide that, in relation to the failure to comply with the rules under the CRP, specific rules for ENRF may lay down specific grounds for interrupting and suspending payments.
, in order to protect the financial interests of the Union and its taxpayers, if the Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the CRP, or where the Commission has evidence indicating such non-compliance, the Commission shall be able to interrupt payment periods under Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.

, in order to ensure legal certainty for Member States implementing operational programmes within the framework of the ENRF, it is necessary to define cases of non-compliance with the CFP rules essential to maintain marine biological resources which may, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, lead to interruptions of payment periods or suspension of payments.
, even if all other sanctions imposed by the CRP rules are affected, these cases will be used for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 and the implementation of Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2014.
, the consequences of failure to comply with the rules of the CFP, which are essential for maintaining biological resources, should be considered serious if the Member State has not taken the necessary measures to remedy the situation which led to the discontinuation of the payment period.
before interrupting or suspending payment, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts pursuant to Article 100(2) and Article 101(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, which further specify the failure to fulfil obligations under the CRP by the Member State which may affect expenditure for which the continuous payment is sought.

, if a 10-year limitation period should start running only when the transfer of APPSA vaccines should be determined at the Ministry of Health, the precise moment of the sale of APMSD by the Ministry of Health should be determined to begin with the date of the time limitation.
, irrespective of whether, in any event, the time limit period for APSA would be interrupted by bringing proceedings against APMSD ( 36 ) on 16 October 2002 of the proceedings against APPA, in any event, before the expiry of the 10-year period, if the marketing of the health ministry was put into circulation on 16 October 1992.
, even if it could no longer be possible to identify the precise moment of the sale of the vaccine minististry and would be possible only to define it for the period between 22 September 1992 – the date of adoption of the vaccine in APMSD – and on 3 November 1992 – vaccination of the defendant – would be the opening of proceedings against APSA on 16 October 2002 in any event of a time limit period of time interrupted.
, if APPSA had to show a moment of placing vaccine into circulation. ( 38 ) APPA would also have to demonstrate the moment of the placing of vaccine into circulation.
, if APPA could only define that moment as a particular period starting more than 10 years before the application was lodged, but it would end less than 10 years before it was lodged, APPA should not only be carried out as a manufacturer not only proof burden but also the risk of determining the precise moment of the time limitation period.
, even if the precise moment of the circulation would not be determined, on 16 October 2002, in any event, the court proceedings would be initiated in time and therefore the effects of interrupting the limitation period should therefore be discontinued.

discussion with Migration issues is already discussed in detail with Moldova and Ukraine in the relevant subcommittees and are also discussed at regular meetings of EU-Ukraine ministerial troikes for Justice, Security and Justice and Justice and the Co-operation Committee meetings.
similar approach follows in the case of three countries of the Southern Caucasus whose action plans were adopted in November 2006.

, as with other antiagregancia, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients with potential risk of increased bleeding after trauma, operation or as a result of other pathological conditions and, if the concomitant administration of clopidogrel and ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-flogist (NSAID) including cox-2 inhibitors or selective re-current inhibitors of serotonin (SRI).
patients should be monitored carefully if they are not shown to show any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or following invasive cardiological performance or surgery.
concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since bleeding intensity may increase (see section 4.5).
, if the patient is to undergo the planned operation and the anti-aggregation effect is not temporarily desirable, clopidogrel should be discontinued for 7 days before the performance.
patients should warn any surgery or other pharmacotherapy of doctors and dentists before planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy that they are taking clopidogrel.
the blood cellopidogrel is delayed for bleeding and should therefore be administered to patients with tendencies to bleeding (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular) cautionally.
patients should be informed that if they are taking clopidogrel (alone or in combination with ASA), the bleeding system could take longer than usual and should inform their doctor about every unusual bleeding (in place of occurrence or duration).

are characterised by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated either with neurological findings, renal dysfunction or fever.
TTP is potentially fatal status requiring uninterrupted treatment including plasmaferease.
ised haemophilia Following use of clopidogrel, haemophilia has been reported.
, where an individual incidence of prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (appTT) is confirmed, the possibility of haemophilia obtained should be taken into account.
patients with confirmed diagnosis obtained by haemophilia should be treated with specialised physicians and clopidogrel administration should be terminated.
recent stroke In view of the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days after acute ischaemic stroke.

: For that purpose, the Commission intends to submit a noise committee referred to in Article 13 of the Work Programme, which contains one of the following elements.
, if necessary, the Commission will also consider whether it will give rise to the judicial procedure to supplement the active implementation of the activities described below.
ising the harmonised framework for maping Maping methods despite improving the comparability of the strategic noise map, the situation is far from ideal.
from the ongoing evaluation, it is apparent that it is still difficult to present comparable figures on the number of persons exposed to excessive noise levels.
problems are linked, inter alia, to different data collection methods, quality and availability of data and the methods used, to evaluate the methods used.
, this is the cause of different results in EU Member States.
the comparability level required will ultimately lead a framework for harmonisation of methods(s) that will reflect the sector specificity sectoral specificity sufficiently.
the Commission began working on the development of harmonised noise exposure methodology (as referred to in Article 6(2)).
project entitled ‘CNOSSOS-EU’ (Common noise evaluation methods in Europe) leading to the Joint Research Centre shall ensure a technical basis for the preparation of the Commission Implementing Decision.
, provided that technical work can be completed in 2011, the Commission considers the possible revision of Annex II to the RSD Directive in early 2012 (as the Committee issued its opinion in 2011 after the Committee on the opinion in 2011).
-in-specific methodology framework could focus on strategic mapping and should carefully balance the needs of harmonisation of adequacy and sectoral specificities, e.g. requirements for data requirements.
, within this Decision, the Commission intends to propose a joint Commission/European Environmental Agency/Member States' Joint Work Programme aimed at implementing the CNOSSOS-EU project in the period 2012-2015, in order to make this project operational for the third cycle of reporting in 2017.
the development of EU Implementing Guidelines The number of aspects of the Directive has not been detailed or leaves space for different interpretations and implementation.
of many Member States proposed that these issues be addressed through a specific action that will help to implement and comply with EU level, e.g. the development of documents with guidance, exchange of information on best practices or by organising special workshops and training courses.
actions could focus on these issues: mapping methods and best practices of mapping, forecast values for noise maps, relationships between dose and response, calculation of repeated exposure, creation of action plans and admissible or target values.
the Commission of the European Communities shall bear its own costs and bear its costs incurred by Anton Pieter Roodhuijzen in the context of this proceeding.

creating a legal and fiscal environment that is favourable to businesses In order to benefit from all the opportunities offered by the single market, including freedom of establishment, the rules on which the single market is based must be simple, adapted and must match the problems with which businesses encounter daily activities.
measures proposed in this section are counted among others by reducing administrative and regulatory burdens, including positive impacts on growth and job creation[17].
initiatives will be adopted in this context to ensure that the interconnection of trade firms and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union will be taken in order to ensure that the interconnection of trade registers and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union.
are also essentially the issues of fiscal. The issues are also fiscal.
actions in the taxation of companies or VAT should limit administrative burden on undertakings and facilitate their cross-border activities.
, moreover, it deserves particular attention to the defence and security sector, as they stimulate development and growth throughout the economy as a result of their high-tech technologies, innovation and know-how.
proposal No 19 : The Commission will take initiatives to improve coordination of national fiscal policies, in particular by proposal for a directive to create a joint consolidated basis for taxation of companies (SKZS) in 2011.
, between 27 existing national taxation systems in the EU, there are large differences, creating significant fiscal obstacles to the cross-border activities of companies or even preventing the activities of companies from being substantially differentiated by the EU.
, such fragmentation leads to a significant market distortion and to the cost of putting into line with the provisions.
ally, it concerns SMEs, often the necessary means to overcome these deficiencies, and can deter them from developing in a single market.
the introduction of a joint consolidated basis of taxation of companies is to address the problem of fiscal provisions which limit growth.
companies should only be managed in fiscal matters and should act only with one fiscal governance in the EU (uniform contact point) in a single set of rules and should be negotiated with one fiscal governance throughout the EU.
vers should be consolidated at group level and losses should be deducted from profit, regardless of the border.
, the dual taxation or double exemption of double taxation due to differences or incompatibility between national fiscal rules would be excluded in the relationships within the group.
-in-ordinated national action would only reproduce the current situation, since companies would still be confronted with so many fiscal systems, how many of the countries in which those companies operate.
, in that regard, it should be borne in mind that Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1515/2001 provides that, if the dispute resolution authority takes a report on non-contested measures, the Council may, if it considers it appropriate, annul or amend the contested measure or adopt other appropriate specific measures in order to take account of the legal interpretations in it formulated.
, in recital 5 of that Regulation, the European Union institutions may consider appropriate to annul or amend measures adopted under the basic Regulation, including those not subject to dispute resolution proceedings under the Memorandum to the rules and procedures governing disputes settlement, or to adopt other specific measures taking into account the legal interpretation contained in the report adopted by the resolution authority.
, secondly, as the applicant rightly states, the provisions of EU law must be interpreted as far as possible in the light of international law, in particular where the objective of those provisions is to implement an international agreement concluded by the Community, such as the basic Regulation adopted to meet international obligations arising from the anti-dumping Agreement (see recital 3 of the basic Regulation).

, by failing to state Article 2 of the decision on a comitology which lays down the non-binding criteria for the choice of procedural conditions to be respected, according to the appellants in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal, it was wrong to state that the regulatory procedure could only be applied to measures with general scope.
: Arguments 43 The Commission considers that the reference to the 30th recital ninth recital in the preamble to Regulation No 3319/94 is not relevant for the purposes of interpreting the second subparagraph of Article 1(3) of that regulation, which imposes a specific duty, if two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of indirect invoicing and imports of the product of ZAP.
, as regards Article 2 of the decision on comitology, the Commission challenges the CMF’s assertion that the Court of First Instance stated that the regulatory procedure can only be applied to measures with general scope.
: Findings of the Court 45 Both parts of the appeal examined and thus the ground of appeal, and that is the very ground of appeal, are not separate.
, as the Advocate General points 41 of his Opinion, both part of the appeal examined, are more specifically raised within the fourth, respective of the third ground of appeal, which is challenged by its own legal analysis carried out by the Court.
, in the light of the appeal, those parts are therefore consistent with the fourth, respect for the third ground of appeal, the appeal is the third ground of appeal.
, in the light of the case, it is not necessary to examine them individually. 49 Consequently, it is not necessary to examine them individually.

, however, it must be held that the Court of First Instance stated that the overall impression which triggered the mark applied for, dominates the element ‘creacies kennya’, to which the consumer concerned will focus on its attention widely and, first, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the element ‘ck’ in relation to the element ‘creaciones kennya’ is only an intervener, which essentially concludes that element ‘ck’ is in the mark applied for.
, on the basis of the correctly analyses, the Court of First Instance excluded any similarity between the marks in which it was held in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, that, despite the good name of the earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.

, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance doubted that the appellant claims a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, whereas the action was also explicitly based on infringement of Article 8(5) of that regulation.
, the Court of First Instance erred in law in finding that, since the conflicting marks were similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of earlier marks.
: The fact that the earlier mark of the CK company Calvin Klein is generally known should be taken into account in the light of the appellant for the purpose of determining whether it is necessary to grant a more extensive protection.
: Good name of the earlier mark must be assessed in assessing the similarity between the marks in which it has been established and not after similarity has been demonstrated.
in that regard, the appellant submits that, if the prolonged mark of the cK was protected only if the third parties were used in the same way as the graphic formation, it would mean that the CK mark would be granted a level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection which would enjoy if it were not generally known.
: The fact that the mark of cK, as well as other distinct graphic formation of those letters, are famous to grant them protection against the use of the letter ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, since this point is identified by Calvin Klein, so that their use by a third party creates confusion through association.
, the OHIM contends that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance has held that, in the judgment under appeal, the earlier mark name.
, since the contested designation cannot be regarded as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 does not apply.
, Zafra Marroquineros states that, in the judgment under appeal, the reference to the good name of earlier marks is made to the earlier marks.

rules for implementing the system should be laid down for implementing rules on that system.
checks of conditionality may be completed before receiving payments and annual premiums referred to in Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receipt of the payments.
in particular where such checks cannot be completed before receiving such payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of administrative sanctions should be paid in accordance with this Regulation or by starting.
rules on authorities in the Member States responsible for the system of monitoring of the obligations in the field of conditionality should be laid down in the Member States.
minimum checks should be fixed for checking the conditionality obligations.
of the checks should be set at least at 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 which fall within the scope of the competent control authorities and who must be selected on the basis of an appropriate risk analysis.
, in particular case of a group of persons in accordance with Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, the Member States should be given flexibility in determining whether the group assesses as a whole or each group member individually.
Member States should be able to choose whether they meet the minimum level of checks at each competent control authority level, at the level of the paying agency or at the level of the act or standard or a set of acts or standards.
, where special legislation applicable to act or standards provides minimum checks, Member States should comply with those rates.
, however, Member States should be allowed to use a uniform level of on-the-spot checks on the spot on conditionality.
, if Member States choose this option, all non-compliance cases identified during the spot checks under sectoral legislation should be reported and subsequently monitored under conditionality.
in order to simplify the requirement for the minimum level of minimum levels laid down in this Regulation should be considered in the context of the conditionality Directive 96/22/EC of the Council Directive ( 10 ) , the application of the specific level of sampling from the monitoring plans should be considered to meet the requirement of the minimum level set out in this Regulation.
Member States should be provided with flexibility necessary to achieve a minimum level of control by using results from other on-the-spot checks or by replacing beneficiaries.
, in order to avoid the weakening of the control system, in particular as regards the selection of sampling for the on-the-spot checks, the minimum control sample should not be taken into account in calculating the minimum control sample relating to the de minimis rule referred to in Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
the detection of significant degree of non-compliance in relation to conditionality should lead to an increase in the number of on-the-spot checks in order to achieve an acceptable level of security as regards the accuracy of the aid applications concerned.

of public finances – public debt and deficit above, at present, the Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit (as referred to in Article 126(6) of the Treaty).
the deficit of public finances to GDP fell from 5.5% in 2011 to 2.1% in 2013 and the Commission’s 2013 economic forecast was to remain at 2.1 % in 2014 at 2.1 % in 2014.
the total public debt at the end of 2013 amounted to 39.4 % of GDP – this is significantly less than it lays down Maastricht Limits.
this criterion also meet Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Sweden.
, the Czech Republic will also meet this criterion if the Council decides to repeal the excessive deficit procedure as proposed by the Commission proposes.
, in the present case, the two Member States (Croatia and Poland) are currently subject to excessive deficit procedure and that criterion does not therefore meet.
